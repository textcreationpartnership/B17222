            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It has Linnen in it, and all her neceſſary things, and all things have been torn from me, ſince I was Apprehended, but what is there. I have nothing to ſubſiſt upon but what is there, for no Money can I get from any body, no body will pay us a farthing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I cou'd not get him till <hi>Thurſday</hi> to me, I had no Meſſengers to ſend till then.</p>

               <p>I gave the Keeper Direction, to let him have Perſons come to him to ſend on any Errand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>The Keeper had Orders, it ſeems, to let any Meſſenger come to you, and he would have help'd you to ſome body to ſend of this Errand to be ſure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Keeper.</speaker>
               <p>I always did it, as ſoon as I know they have Notice of their Tryal.</p>

               <p>But the Keeper is not always in the Way, and beſides, when I had Notice given me of my Tryal, it was Execution Day, and he was not at home that Day.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I was Committed this Day Fortnight.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Your Commitment charg'd you with High Treaſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you knew what you ſtood accus'd of, were you not committed for High Treaſon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>You might have had a Copy of your Commitment, you had a Right to have it, and thereby you might have ſeen what you were accuſed of.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Baker.</speaker>
               <p>I gave him Notice of his Tryal on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> and then told him he muſt prepare for it againſt this Day; he ſaid he would endeavour to Petition for a longer Time, I told him it would be in Vain, for he muſt prepare for his Tryal to Day, and could have no longer Time.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>William,</hi> truly we do not ſee any Reaſon to put off the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al upon theſe Suggeſtions.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> it is very hard; then I humbly beg I may have the Favour, that I may have Counſel allow'd me, I have no skill in Indictments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>We cannont allow Counſel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> if I have no Counſel, I do not underſtand theſe Matters, nor what Advantage may be Proper for me to take in theſe Caſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>You are not ignorant, Sir <hi>William,</hi> that Counſel has been always refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when deſired in ſuch Caſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, there is a new Act of Parliament that is lately made, which allows Counſel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>But that does not commence yet, Sir <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it wants but one Day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>That is as much as if it were a much longer time: for we are to proceed according to what the Law is, and not what it will be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>But it is declarative of the Common Law, becauſe it ſays it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways juſt and reaſonable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>We cannot alter the Law till Law-makers do it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Will your Lordſhip be pleaſed to let it be read?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Aye, if you have a Mind to it, it ſhall be read.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Yes, if your Lordſhip pleaſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>

               <p>Reads. An Act for Regulating of Tryals in Caſes of Treaſon, and Miſpriſion of Treaſon. —</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>All the firſt Paragraph of the New Act was read.</stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Look ye, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> this Law has not taken any Effect as yet; but the Law ſtands as it did before the making of this Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>But, My Lord, the Law ſays it's juſt and reaſonable that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>We go according to the Law as we find it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>And, My Lord, what is juſt and reaſonable to Morrow, ſure is juſt and reaſonable to Day, and your Lordſhip may indulge me in this Caſe, eſpecially when you ſee how ſtreight Notice I have had, and what a little time has been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that I am not able to make my defence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L C. J Holt.</speaker>
               <p>We cannot make a Law, we muſt go according to the Law, that muſt be our Rule and Direction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, but what is juſt and reaſonable, ſure is Law: the Law is grounded upon Reaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>The Parliament has thought fit to make ſuch a Law, which is to commence from the 25th of this Month: It is not a Law till the time comes that the Parliament hath appointed for its being a Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>But, my Lord, if my Notice had been a convenient Notice, I had been within the time limited by the Act of Parliament; and no one can want the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of that Act from henceforward, nor ſuffer for ſuch want but my ſelf, which is a particular Hardſhip upon me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>We cannot alter the Law, we are bound by our Oaths to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the Law as it is at preſent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, my Lord, let the Tryal be put off till another Day then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>You ſhew no reaſon for it; you name no Witneſſes that you want, nor have we any Oath as we ought to have in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I will do both if your Lordſhip will oblige me to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>There ought to be an Oath certainly, but we think you have had fair and convenient Notice: For you have had as much Notice as Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> had, who was tryed Yeſterday.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>As I am informed he was charged with ſingle Facts about the Town, but I am charged with many particular Things more than he was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>The Act of Parliament ſays nothing of Notice of Tryal; that ſtill continues as it was before; and you have had very convenient Notice: Go on Mr. <hi>Hardeſty</hi> to ſwear the Jury.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> you have Challenged two, and have aſſign'd the Cauſe of your Challenge, that is, <hi>Hancock</hi> and another, and the reaſon of your Challenge is, becauſe they are the King's Servants. I am to acquaint you, that is no cauſe of Challenge; but however the King's Counſel do not intend to inſiſt upon it, if there are enough beſides. They are willing to go on with the Pannel; and I ſpeak this becauſe I would not have it go for a Preſident, nor have it underſtood that the Cauſe you aſſign is a good Cauſe: but however they will not ſtand with you, if there be enough to ſerve.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Montague.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, this Indictment does contain as heavy an Accuſation, as can be laid upon any Man, for it not only charges the Priſoner with a Traiterous deſign of ſubverting the Government, and raiſing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106669:6"/> War and Rebellion within the Kingdom; which was to be done by adhering to the King's Enemies, and promoting a Forreign Invaſion, but likewiſe with a Conſpiracy againſt the Life of the King, which was to have been taken away by a bloody Aſſaſſination.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Indictment ſets forth, That Sir <hi>Will. Parkyns,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, did meet ſeveral times with <hi>Chernock</hi> and other falſe Traytors; and there it was conſulted, and agreed how they ſhould procure <hi>French</hi> Forces to Land within this Kingdom, and then they were to raiſe Rebellion among his Majeſty's Subjects, to joyn with the Invadors. Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> was ſent from the Priſoner at the Bar, and the reſt, as a Meſſenger into <hi>France,</hi> unto the late King <hi>James</hi> to acquaint him with this Bloody Deſign; and to deſire him to borrow of the <hi>French</hi> King as many Troops as he could ſpare to make a Deſcent upon this Kingdom, and they at the ſame time were to facilitate the Deſcent, by getting as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men as they could to make the Aſſaſſination; and the number of Forty was pitched upon, who were to be provided for that purpoſe, of which the Priſoner at the Bar was to find Five, who were to lye in wait with the reſt, and ſet upon the King as he came along in his Coach upon his Return from Hunting. Some were to aſſault and attack the Guards, while others were barbarouſly to Aſſaſſinate and Murder the King in his Coach: and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly it Charges the Priſoner with undertaking to procure and provide Five Horſes and Arms that were to be Imployed in this Bloody Aſſaſſination, and alſo with gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether great Quantities of Arms and Ammunition that were to be uſed in the Inſurrection. To this Indictment the Priſoner has pleaded Not Guilty; if he be not Guilty, God forbid he ſhould be Convicted; but if he be Guilty, and we prove the Fact, the Nation expects that you will do Juſtice to the King and Kingdom, and find him ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Attorn. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the Bar, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> ſtands Indicted of High Treaſon, for Compaſſing the Death of his Majeſty, and adhering to his Majeſty's Enemies; and the Overt Acts laid in the Indictment to prove this Treaſon are, That he with others had ſeveral Meetings and Conſultations about this Deſign, and ſent a Meſſenger over to <hi>France</hi> to the late King <hi>James,</hi> to procure <hi>French</hi> Forces to Invade the Kingdom, to Depoſe the King, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Kingdom to a <hi>French</hi> Power: And likewiſe that he did enter into a Conſpiracy with ſeveral Perſons for the Aſſaſſination of his Majeſty's Royal Perſon. Theſe are the Overt Acts mentioned in the Indictment, to prove this Charge of Treaſon againſt the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Evidence to prove theſe Overt Acts, and which we ſhall produce, will be in this manner. It will appear that the Priſoner at the Bar, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> has formerly had a Commiſſion from King <hi>James</hi> to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe, and about <hi>May</hi> laſt, he with ſeveral others had a Meeting at the <hi>Old King's-head</hi> in <hi>Leadenhall-ſtreet,</hi> where were preſent my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Sir <hi>John Freind,</hi> Sir <hi>John Fenwick;</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Cook;</hi> and <hi>Goodman</hi> came in to them after Dinner. And at that Meeting it was Conſulted and Conſerted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, how they ſhould bring back the late King <hi>James,</hi> and Depoſe his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and in order to that they did Reſolve to ſend Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> as a Meſſenger to the late King <hi>James,</hi> to deſire him to obtain from the <hi>French</hi> King 10000 Men to Invade this Kingdom; 8000 Foot, 1000 Horſe, and 1000 Dragoons; and to Incourage the late King to this, they did aſſure him by the ſame Meſſenger, that they would meet him with 2000 Horſe upon his Landing; and they did all undertake and agree that they would do it: and Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> undertook to go of this Meſſage.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, about a Week after this Meeting, Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> not being willing to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Errand without a good Aſſurance that they intended to perform what they had Reſolved upon, they therefore had another Meeting of moſt of the ſame Perſons that were at the former, and particularly the Priſoner at the Bar was one; and that was at Mrs. <hi>Mountjoyes</hi> a Tavern in St. <hi>James's-ſtreet.</hi> And at that Meeting they did all agree, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and continued in their former Reſolution, to ſend Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> to aſſure the late King, that they would meet him, according as they had promiſed, if he would give them notice where he was to Land, and he ſhould not fail of their Aſſiſtance. And at theſe Meetings they did take notice, that then was the moſt proper time for ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion; for the King was gone to <hi>Flanders,</hi> moſt of the Forces were drawn thither, and the People were diſſatisfied, and ſo it would be the fitteſt opportunity to accompliſh their Deſign; and they deſired Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> to make haſte to carry this Meſſage, and to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106669:7"/> King <hi>James</hi> that he would be ſpeedy and expeditious in his coming, that they might not looſe this ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, after theſe Meetings, Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> did within a few days go over into <hi>France,</hi> and did deliver his Meſſage to the late King <hi>James,</hi> who took it very kindly, but ſaid that the <hi>French</hi> King could not ſpare ſo many Forces that year, having other work to Imploy them about: upon which, within a Months time, or leſs, he came back again, and brought an account of his Meſſage to thoſe Gentlemen that ſent him. This was in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> laſt, and ſo the further proſecution of the Deſign ceaſt at that time.</p>
               <p>But Gentlemen, the laſt Winter it was revived again, and attempted, and carried on very near to the obtaining a fatal Succeſs. And you will hear that the Priſoner at the Bar, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> has had too great a hand, and been a very great Inſtrument in both the Parts of this wicked Conſpiracy and Treaſon; not only in the Invaſion, which he with others ſent the Meſſenger over to pocure, but alſo in the other part, the blackeſt part, even the Aſſaſſination of the King's Perſon.</p>
               <p>About <hi>January</hi> laſt Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> a Lieutenant of the Guards to King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was ſent over into <hi>England</hi> to ingage Perſons to joyn in the Conſpiracy and Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination; and for his Aſſiſtance there were ſent over with him, and before and after him, ſome 20 Troopers of the late Kings, that were his Guards in <hi>France.</hi> And Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> to incourage the Perſons that were to joyn, and whom he had brought over with him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an Authority to juſtifie it, that is, a Commiſſion from the late King <hi>James,</hi> and he Communicates this Deſign to Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and ſeveral others, and amongſt the reſt to the Priſoner at the Bar, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> having a great Confidence in him, and did acquaint him he had ſuch a Commiſſion, and he ſhewed it him, and that Commiſſion was to levy War againſt the King's Perſon; which they took to be a ſufficient Authority for them to Aſſaſſinate the King's Perſon.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in order to the accompliſhing this horrid Conſpiracy, there were ſeveral Meetings, and Conſultations had, at which the Priſoner at the Bar was preſent, and very active. Sometimes they met at Capt. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodgings, at another time at the <hi>Naggs-head</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> at another time at the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and another time at the <hi>Globe</hi> in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> in order to accompliſh this Deſign: And at theſe Meetings, you will hear, they did propoſe ſeveral ways and methods for the execution of it; and ſeveral Perſons, particularly one of them that have ſuffered the Puniſhment of the Law for this, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to go and view the Ground where the King's Perſon might moſt conveniently be aſſaulted. Mr. <hi>King,</hi> that was Executed for it, was one, Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> was another, and one <hi>Knightly</hi> was the third; and theſe did go to ſee the Ground. And the day before they went there was a Meeting, at which was preſent the Priſoner at the Bar, and others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'twas concluded upon that they ſhould go; and they went accordingly to ſee the moſt convenient place for it. They went to <hi>Brentford,</hi> and afterwards to the other ſide of the Water to <hi>Richmond,</hi> and ſurvey'd all the Ground, and the Place they pitch'd upon as the moſt proper for their purpoſe, was when his Majeſty ſhould Return from Hunting, to do it in the Lane betwixt <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnham-Green.</hi> And accordingly, when they return'd in the Evening, they came by appointment to the place where the reſt of the Accomplices were to meet, at the <hi>Nagg's-head</hi> Tavern in St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and gave an account of ther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and at that Meeting likewiſe was Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and ſeveral others, and upon the Report of Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>King</hi>'s Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they did Reſolve the thing ſhould be done in that place, and that it ſhould be done in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> with about 8 or 10 in his Party, who were to be choſen out of all the other Parties, were to aſſault the King's Coach, and endeavour to kill the King, and all the reſt that were in the Coach with him, whilſt the others, in two Parties, were to attack the Guards; the number in all was to be about 40. This was fully agreed upon.</p>
               <p>And, Gentlemen, the firſt time that they Reſolved to put this Traiterous Deſign in Execution, was the Fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> which was a <hi>Saturday:</hi> the uſual day that the King was wont to go a Hunting in; but it hapned by great Providence that the King did not go abroad that day.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106669:7"/>
               <p>They had contrived further to make the thing ſure, that there ſhould be two Perſons, whom they called orderly Men, who ſhould be placed at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> to give Notice when the King went abroad; and <hi>Chambers</hi> was one, and <hi>Durance</hi> that was a <hi>Fleming</hi> was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and <hi>Durance</hi> was likewiſe imployed to view the Inns about <hi>Turnham-Green</hi> and <hi>Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> for the lodging of their Men, who were to be placed two or three in an Inn, that they might not be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the firſt Day appointed for the accompliſhing this Deſign, which was the 15th of <hi>February,</hi> being over, and they diſappointed; yet they did afterwards reſolve to go on and execute it. And the next <hi>Saturday,</hi> which was the 22th of <hi>February,</hi> was pitched upon for the time of Execution; and accordingly on <hi>Friday</hi> the 21th of <hi>February,</hi> the day before, there was a Meeting at the <hi>Nag's-head</hi> in <hi>Covent Garden;</hi> and there was preſent Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> and ſeveral others, and amongſt the reſt, the Priſoner at the Bar was there; they had at firſt ſome Diſcourſe among them that they were in doubt, becauſe of the firſt Diſappointment, whether there had not been ſome Diſcovery; but that Doubt was ſoon over; for it was ſaid, it could not be ſo, for then they ſhould not have been there together. That ſeemed probable, and the Diſappointment was imputed to ſome Accident, and that gave them new Aſſurance to go on, and they were reſolved to do it in the ſame manner, as they had formerly reſolved, on the next Day, which was <hi>Saturday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, at that Meeting Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> acquainted them that he had the Misfortune to have ſome of his Horſes fallen ſick or lame, and he acquainted the Priſoner with it; and Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was careful to ſupply him with other Horſes, and told him, he could get a Note from one <hi>Lewis,</hi> who I think is Major of the Horſe to my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> to get three Horſes, and accordingly he did ſend a Note for three Horſes to Mr. <hi>Lewis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the 22th of <hi>February</hi> in the Morning, which was the time for the Execution of this bloody Conſpiracy, they had met together, and reſolved to go on with it, and put it in Execution; and they had Notice from <hi>Chambers</hi> that the King did go a Hunting that Day, and there was great Joy among them all, thinking themſelves ſure; and ſo they ordered all things to be got ready. But afterwards, about One a Clock, there came other News, that the King did not go abroad, but the Guards were all come back in great haſte, their Horſes being all of a Foam, and the King's Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were ſent back to the <hi>Mews;</hi> then they began to be in a great Conſternation, and they thought the thing had taken Air, and was diſcovered. This, Gentlemen, is a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how it will appear upon the Evidence as to the Conſpiracy of Aſſaſſinating the King, and the ſeveral Meetings and Conſultations about it; at which the Priſoner at the Bar, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> was preſent.</p>
               <p>But, Gentlemen, there will be a little more Evidence, if it be neceſſary, to confirm this former Evidence, and to ſhew the part that the Priſoner at the Bar had in this barbarous, Treaſonable Conſpiracy: For it will appear, that, as the Priſoner had a Commiſſion from the late King <hi>James</hi> to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe, and had ſent a Meſſenger into <hi>France</hi> to invite the late King over, with 10000 French; ſo he had made great Preparation of Arms to be ready for that Purpoſe. About <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, the Priſoner at the Bar ſent a parcel of Goods, as he called them, which were put into Caſes, I think they were about Eight ſmall Boxes, put in very large Caſes, and ſent down by his Order into the Country, unto one <hi>Haywood.</hi> It ſeems this <hi>Haywood</hi> had married Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Siſter, and <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> writ a Letter to him, and deſired that he would give Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> leave to lodge ſome Goods there, which were of great value, and he durſt not truſt them at his own Houſe in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> becauſe his Servants were not there to look after them, and accordingly upon that Letter Mr. <hi>Haywood</hi> did give leave that the Goods ſhould be carried thither, and they were ſo, and there they were lock'd up privately, and kept till this Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Conſpiracy was diſcovered; then you will find the Priſoner at the Bar ſent his own Servant down, the <hi>Tueſday</hi> after the Diſcovery, and gave him Orders immediately (his Name is <hi>Ubanck,</hi> and he is the Groom, and looks after his Horſes) to go down to <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire</hi> to one <hi>Evans,</hi> who carried the Goods, to deſire him with all ſpeed to remove thoſe Goods, and to take care to remove them privately, and to ſecure them, and to hide them. And accordingly on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> he came there, which was <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday;</hi> and acquainted <hi>Evans</hi> with what Sir <hi>William</hi> had ordered him, and they went that very Night with a Cart to Mr. <hi>Haywood</hi>'s; and though it was late, and they were deſired to ſtay till the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they would not; they ſaid, they could ſtay no longer, but would remove the Goods
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106669:8"/> immediately; and accordingly they were carried from thence that Night, to Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> own Houſe in <hi>Warwickſhire;</hi> and there they were buried in the Garden. Theſe Goods that were of this great value were put into the Ground to preſerve them. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Diſcovery, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> being accuſed, and his Name put in the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Search being ordered to be made at his Houſe, theſe Goods that lay hid at <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s, and upon the removal thence were thus buried in the Ground, came to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the Caſes were broken open, and then they did appear to be Goods of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Nature indeed, for you will find they were Horſe Arms for Troopers; there were two and thirty Carbines, five and twenty Caſes of Piſtols, and about forty odd Swords without Hilts upon them, but the Hilts lay looſe by them; ſo that this will make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, without Diſpute, how far the Priſoner at the Bar has engaged in this Conſpiracy, and what Preparations he had made for the Execution of it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it will appear further againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, that he hath had a conſiderable Number of Horſes, that have frequently been brought up from his Houſe in <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> to the <hi>George-Inn</hi> in <hi>Houlbourn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before we come to that, I would acquaint you with another particular part of our Evidence, that is precedent in point of time. About <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, the Priſoner did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint one <hi>Sweet,</hi> who is an Officer of the Exciſe, (and I am very ſorry that we ſhould have any ſuch Officers, that ſhould be thought fit to be intruſted with Secrets of this nature) Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> acquainted this <hi>Sweet,</hi> and gave him an Account that he had long had an Aſſurance that King <hi>James</hi> would Land, but now he had it under his own Hand, that he would land very ſpeedily, and that he had made Preparations for that purpoſe to meet him. That great things were expected from him; that his own Troop was ready, and it conſiſted chiefly of old Souldiers; and that ſeveral Perſons who had been Officers would be Volunteers under him. He ſaid, he intended to go into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and there he was to meet ſeveral Gentlemen from the North, and from the Weſt, to conſider, and ſettle a Correſpondence how to meet the late King upon his Landing; and accordingly Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> did go, and you will have an account that he came to <hi>Leiceſter</hi> on Friday night, one <hi>Scudimore</hi> went along with him, there he ſtaid all Saturday, and a good part of Sunday. There came ſeveral perſons to him while he was at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> particularly one Captain <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> the Son of Sir <hi>Thomas Yarborough,</hi> and a Parſon, who ſaid they came as far as from <hi>York</hi> to meet Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> at <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> and there was great reſort thither at that time, as you will hear from the Witneſſes. Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkyns</hi> came back again from <hi>Leiceſter</hi> to <hi>Brickhill,</hi> that night, and returned to his own Houſe on Monday night; and after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he acquainted this <hi>Sweet,</hi> that he had been his Journey to <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> that he met with ſeveral Gentlemen there from the North, and other places, and had ſetled a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and had found them all fully Ingaged, and well Inclined, all went well, and there was no danger of any Miſcarriage at all; and this was about <hi>January</hi> laſt, that this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was made by the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>And now, Gentlemen, as to that particular about the Horſes, which were ſo frequently brought up this laſt Winter from his Houſe in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> to the <hi>George-Inn</hi> in <hi>Holbourn;</hi> there is one very unfortunate Circumſtance that attends this Matter; that is, that theſe Horſes were brought to Town juſt the ſeveral Nights before the King was to be aſſaſſinated; for upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 13th of <hi>February,</hi> he being in Town, ſent Directions to his Groom to bring up three of his Horſes on <hi>Friday,</hi> which was the 14th in the Afternoon, and all theſe Horſes were furniſhed with Piſtols and Furniture for Troopers; according to thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections his Servant brought up the three Horſes, and he came and acquainted his Maſter that they were brought up according to his Order; Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was then at his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which were in the ſame Houſe where Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> did lodge; when his Man had told him the Horſes were come, he pretended at firſt that he had had ſome Thoughts of going out of Town that Evening, but that he had changed his Mind, and would go in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and he would have the Horſes ready againſt the next Morning, which was <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15th, the firſt Day upon which the Aſſaſſination was intended to be put in Execution.</p>
               <p>The next Morning when his Man came to him again, he had changed his Mind, and he would not go out of Town in the Morning, but he would go in the Afternoon; and it will appear that he did not go out of Town that Day, nor the next Day, nor till <hi>Monday;</hi> and then the Deſign had miſcarried by the King's not going abroad a <hi>Saturday,</hi> and the Horſes were carried back; and when he went out of Town upon <hi>Monday,</hi> one <hi>Holmes</hi> went along with him, and he went with him to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106669:8"/> his houſe in <hi>Hartfordſhire;</hi> and there he ſtaid until <hi>Fryday</hi> after, which was the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next time that was appointed for the Execution of the Aſſaſſination. And upon the <hi>Fryday</hi> they came up again, and then there were more Horſes, 4 or 5, that were brought up that Day; and all of them with Piſtolls, and Jack Bootes, and other Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Accoutriments for Troopers; and theſe came to the <hi>George Inn,</hi> where Sir <hi>Wil. Parkins</hi> gave his man <hi>Eubank</hi> perticuler Orders, to be very early the next Morning at <hi>Kenſington;</hi> that was the 22d. and he was to go, as he told him, to one <hi>Brown,</hi> that he ſaid was Concern'd in the Kings Kitchin, and Liv'd 2 Doors off the Gate that turns up to the Kings houſe, and he was to tell him he was Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi>'s ſervant, but that he came from a man that Lodg'd at a Confectioners houſe over againſt <hi>Grays Inn;</hi> in which place by the Deſcription of the perſon, you will find Sir <hi>Geo. Barclay</hi> lodged.</p>
               <p>The man went accordingly at 8 a Clock in the Morning to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> and inquir'd out this <hi>Brown,</hi> and met with him, and told him he was Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi>'s ſervant, but came from the Gentleman that Lodg'd at the Confectioners in <hi>Holbourn.</hi> Brown ſaid he had nothing to ſay to him, but bid him give him his Almanack, and he writ in it, that he wou'd be in Town in 2 hours himſelf, and wait upon him: And bid him carry that to the man that lodg'd at the Confectioners, and this <hi>Brown</hi> by the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the whole, muſt probably be one of the Orderly men who lodg'd at <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington,</hi> to give notice when the King, and the Gurds went out.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Wil. Parkins</hi>'s ſervant came back to the Confectioners houſe, and there he met with a man that went by the name of <hi>Rogers;</hi> he'll tell you he was a <hi>Scotch</hi> man, for he ſpoke broad <hi>Scotch,</hi> and he'll give you a particular Deſcription of the man, by which I believe it will appear that it was Sir <hi>Geo. Barclay.</hi> Sir <hi>Wil. Parkins</hi>'s ſervant after he had Deliver'd his Meſſuage to this <hi>Rogers,</hi> came back to his Maſter, and told him he had done his Errand according as he was order'd, and Sir <hi>Wil. Parkins</hi> ask't him what <hi>Rogers</hi> ſaid, and he told him that he bid him tell his Maſter, if he wou'd come to him he wou'd be ready at home for him. This was upon <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning the 22d. of <hi>February.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About 11 a Clock that day Sir <hi>Wil. Parkins,</hi> and this <hi>Lewis</hi> that we ſpoke of before, came to the <hi>George Inn,</hi> and there Sir <hi>Wil. Parkins</hi> ask't his ſervant whether he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd any more then 2 Sadles, for there were 2 Sadles ſent in thither, according to an order that hath been given, to furniſh two other Horſes that ſtood their at the <hi>George Inn,</hi> and which Sir <hi>W. Parkings</hi> told his Groom belonged to two Friends of his, and bid him beſure to take care of them, and to ſee them well fed, and order'd 2 Sadles to be bought for them. <hi>Lewis</hi> ſaid he did think they had more then two, but you will ſee by the Evidence that this ſame <hi>Lewis</hi> had provided 30 Sadles for Sir <hi>Wi. Parkins;</hi> but there ſeem'd to be a Controverſy between them and that time how many had really been ſent in, and <hi>Lewis</hi> affirm'd there was 24, but Sir <hi>W. Perkins</hi> ſaid, I have had but 22 of the 30 yet, for I have but 2 brought in here, and I had 20 before. This you will hear fully prov'd, and I think it is Impoſſible for any body to believe, but that all this preparation of Sadles, Piſtols, Boots, and other things, muſt Convince any body of the Priſoners being ſo far Ingaged in this Deſign, that he can never Anſwer it without giving you a very good Account, what this preparation was for.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, a great part of this will be prov'd to you by one that Acted in it, as a ſervant to Sir <hi>W. Parkins,</hi> that is, as to the comming up of the Horſes, Jack Bootes, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols, and other Arms at that time; and that when on the laſt <hi>Saturday</hi> it was Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, all the Horſes, not only thoſe Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> brought, but the other two went away in a great Hurry, and Confuſion, and nothing was ever heard of them more; and that will be prov'd by the Servants in the very <hi>Inn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have now open'd to you the nature and ſtate of the Evidence, we will call our Witneſſes, and make it out very undeniably, and Subſtantially, and therefore I will not give you any further trouble.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106669:9"/> and there we Conſulted which was the beſt way for King <hi>James</hi>'s coming in, and we all Reſolv'd to ſend a Meſſenger to him to to Invite him over, and to deſire him to Interpoſe with the French King for the Getting 10000 men, to come over with him, 8000 Foot, 1000 Horſe, and 1000 Dragoons.

               <p>About ſome weeks before I heard of the Aſſaſſination; I came to Lodg in the houſe in <hi>Norfolk ſtreet,</hi> where Capt. <hi>Chernock</hi> Lodg'd, and where Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> Lodg'd when he came to Town. Moſt commonly we us'd to go in the Evening to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, or Drink a Bottle of Wine at our own Lodgings; and one Morning I ask'd Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> if I ſhould ſee him at Night, he ſaid he was Ingag'd in private Company for that Night, and he could not go with me to the Tavern. For ſays he there are ſome Gentlemen that are lately come from <hi>France,</hi> and there is ſomething to be done for the Kings ſervice. If there be ſo, ſays I, pray let me be concern'd? ſays he, they are but newly come, and they will ſee no body elſe but me at preſent. A little after I fell ſick of a fit of the Gout, and Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> came to Viſit me, and we fell into Diſcourſe, and I ask'd him about thoſe Gentlemen that were come from <hi>France,</hi> what they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; he told me it was Sir <hi>G. Barclay</hi> that came from <hi>France,</hi> and ſeveral other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers with him, and that he had a Commiſſion from the late King <hi>James</hi> to Levy War againſt the Perſon of King <hi>William,</hi> or the Prince of Orange, as I think it was named in the Commiſſion.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>It was Capt. <hi>Chernock:</hi> He deſir'd to Know how many men I could bring. I deſir'd a little time to Conſider, but I ſaid there would be a great many that would Joyn if the King landed (whom I did not think fit to Truſt with a thing of this nature before hand.) Some few Days after, Capt. <hi>Chernock</hi> came into my Chamber, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106669:9"/> brought Sir <hi>G.

               <p>There were ſeveral propoſitions about the Place where it was to be done, one was to be on the other ſide of the Water by Ambuſcade in <hi>Richmond</hi> Park, the other was to be on this ſide of the Water after the King was Landed. Sir <hi>G. Barclay</hi> was for that that was upon the other ſide of the Water; I thought that would take up too much time to go over thither, that it was better to be done on this ſide; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was Difference of Opinions, It was Reſolved upon that ſome body ſhould be appointed to view the Ground; and I was appointed for one, Mr. <hi>Knightly</hi> for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Mr. <hi>King</hi> would needs go with us for a Third, and we three did go. We lay all Night at <hi>Knights bridge,</hi> and the next Day went and view'd the Grounds on both ſides the River; and came back that Evening to the <hi>Naggs head</hi> according to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where was Sir <hi>W.

               <p>Sir <hi>G. Barclay</hi> came in, and ſaid he was afraid the thing was Diſcover'd; I told him I fancyed not, for if it had we ſhould not have been in that houſe at that time. Then ſays he, let us go on and try another day. Sir <hi>W. Parkyns</hi> was ask'd if his Horſes were come to Town? he ſaid they were come to Town that Night. Said I, I have had a misfortune with my Horſes, two of them are fallen Lame, and and won't be fit for ſervice. Says he, if I had known that, I could have brought more Horſes out of the Country: But ſays he, I will ſend to Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was Gentleman of the Horſe to my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and I believe he can help us to more Horſes; he will be with me to Morrow morning, and Ile get a Note from him for two more. In the Morning I ſent to him, and he ſent me a Note for two Horſes to mount my men, and he ſent me word Mr, <hi>Lewis</hi> could help me to 2 or 3 others, that they were all 3 Sadled, and one was Accoutred with Holſters and Piſtolls, but the other 2 had only Sadles. I did not ſee Sir <hi>W. Parkyns,</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d. but I met ſome of my friends, who were to go along with me upon this Enterpriſe, and we had firſt notice that the Guards were gone abroad, and that the King would go, at which all were very glad: But when we had notice that the King did not go, we were afraid the thing was Diſcover'd, and I went out of Town, and I did not ſee any of them afterwards till they were taken.</p>

               <p>Why, before the Team came (about a quarter of an hour before) to fetch theſe Goods, my Maſter told me, that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>'s men were to come to fetch ſome Bedding and other Goods, what they were he knew not, and he order'd me when they knock'd at the Gate, to let them in; and I did ſo.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Well Friend, did they carry away any Goods, and what were they?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hipwell.</speaker>
               <p>They were in Boxes, at firſt in three Boxes; and then Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>'s Servant did knock off the outſide Lining, which was a Deal Board, and he drew the Nails and took out of two Boxes three Boxes apiece, and two out of another, to the beſt of my remembrance I think there were eight, but I am not ſure whether there were ſeven or eight.</p>

               <p>Yes, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>'s Man <hi>Richard</hi> and the Tenant carried them to the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and I lighted them down with a Lanthorn, according to my Maſters Order.</p>

               <p>My Lord, about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>'s Man came to me with a Letter from one Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and the effect of the Letter was to deſire the favour of me to lodge ſome Goods of Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> at my Houſe; for he was taking his Servants from his Houſe, and he was loath to leave his Goods in an empty Houſe; and he deſired me to let them lye at my Houſe, which I did.</p>

               <p>I think it was upon a <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi> that I came home, and my Wife ſaid Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> had ſent for his Goods, and deſired to have them away, but that ſhe had made anſwer, I was not at home, but ſhould be at home ſoon, and then he might have them away. The next day I came home from <hi>Litchfield</hi> Fair about 5 or 6 a Clock at Night; it was <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday</hi> at Night when I came home, and the man came to me between 6 and 7, and told me his Maſter deſired to have the Goods away. I told him he might have them when he would; he ſaid he would have them away that Night. I told him it was an unſeaſonable time: But, ſays he, the Waggon is a coming, and I deſire you would give me leave to take them away, which I did: Then he ſaid he had but two Horſes, and he deſired me to lend him a Horſe, which I did, and he took the Goods and went away with them, but for what he did afterwards with it, I know nothing at all of it.</p>

               <speaker>Freeman.</speaker>
               <p>Only the <hi>Roan</hi> Gelding, and a very fat Man mounted him and rid out with Sir <hi>W. Parkyns.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freeman.</speaker>
               <p>They were no great ſized Horſes none of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freeman.</speaker>
               <p>No not the <hi>Roan</hi> but the others: they were no ſtrange Horſes, they were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there all laſt Summer: there was no new ſtrange Horſe but the <hi>Roan.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Then ſet up Mr. <hi>Turton.</hi> 
                  <stage>(which was done)</stage>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray will you give an Account what you know of Horſes that were ſtanding at the <hi>George-Inn</hi> in <hi>Holbourn.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Turton.</speaker>
               <p>I have known Sir <hi>W. Parkyns</hi> to have uſed the Inn this 4 or 5 Years, ever ſince the Inn was Built; and in laſt <hi>February</hi> he came to Town with three horſes the firſt time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>What Day of the month was that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Turton.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay what Day of the month, but it was about the VVeek before his laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, which was juſt before the diſcovery of the Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Do you know what day of the VVeek it was?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Turton.</speaker>
               <p>No truly I do not, for I keep no account of Horſes going in or out. The laſt time of his coming was with about 4 or 5 Horſes to the beſt of my knowledge, and that was upon the <hi>Friday</hi> before the Plot broke out; and then upon that <hi>Friday,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Parkyns</hi> gave order to his Groom to get the Horſes ready againſt <hi>Saturday</hi> morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did he go out with his Horſes on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Turton.</speaker>
               <p>He did not go out with all the Horſes according as he had given order; but two Gentlemen rid out with two of the Horſes, and ſtaid out about two or three hours and came in again, as if they had rid pretty hard, the Horſes being in a ſweat; and in the Afternoon they all went fairly out of Town, and gave out that they expected to be in Town on <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Monday</hi> following, but they did not return; but then came down one Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> I know not that that is his Name, only when I formerly belonged to my Lord of <hi>Oxford,</hi> I knew him to be Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Horſe to my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> But I did not know his Name.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Had you not ſeen him there before, what time did he come?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Turton.</speaker>
               <p>I do not know that I ever ſaw him there before; he was on <hi>Saturday</hi> in our Yard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. H.</speaker>
               <p>You are asked when <hi>Lewis</hi> came?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Turton.</speaker>
               <p>The firſt time I ſee him was on <hi>Saturday,</hi> in the Yard asking for Sir <hi>W. Parkyns.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. H.</speaker>
               <p>VVhat time on <hi>Saturday</hi> was that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Turton.</speaker>
               <p>It might be three of the Clock in the Afternoon, about an hour or thereabouts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> Horſes went away; and asking for Sir <hi>W. Parkyns,</hi> and he not being there, he returned back again; and after they were gone he came again, and I told him they were gone, but the Groom had acquainted me, and given me an account, that he would be there again on <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Monday.</hi> On <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Afternoon about five or ſix, Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> came to enquire if Sir <hi>W. Parkyns</hi> Horſes were come to Town; I told him no: and ſo he came again upon <hi>Monday</hi> morning betwixt eight and nine of the Clock, and asked me if I heard nothing of his coming to Town; I told him no I did not hear of his coming again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>The Horſes that came up on <hi>Friday</hi> night, how were they accoutred?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Turton.</speaker>
               <p>Two or three of them had Holſters; I cannot ſay but for Piſtols they had four or five Caſe.</p>

               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>That ſhews it is not probable I ſhould tell him ſo, that I ſhould have it from his own Mouth, carries ſuch an improbability with it, that the Evidence is <hi>Felo de. ſe,</hi> it deſtroys it ſelf.</p>

               <p>Look you, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> there is another thing I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, why did you ſend your Man to <hi>Kenſington</hi> to one <hi>Brown?</hi> who is that <hi>Brown,</hi> and what was the Man that lodged at the Confectioners in <hi>Holbourn.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell who it was, I know neither <hi>Brown</hi> nor the other Man, but I ſent my Man at the requeſt of Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> who lodged in the ſame Houſe with me; he deſired he might go upon an Errand for him to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> and I directed him to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106669:16"/> go upon ſuch an Errand, for he was formerly Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Servant, and I deſired him to go of the Errand if he requeſted it. Who theſe Men were I know not, neither of them, nor any of their Buſineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>But he was bid by the Man that lodged at the Confectioners to tell his Maſter that he would ſtay within for him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>That might be Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> for he was his Servant once.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>But he ſays he carry'd the Meſſage to you, and you receiv'd it. Well have you any more to ſay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think there is but one poſitive Evidence of any one Overt-Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, what do you think of the deſign of bringing in King <hi>James,</hi> and conſulting about it, and aſſiſting in the Invaſion, and preparing a Troop, and providing Arms and Horſes, are not theſe Overt-Acts. Do you think your having a Troop of old Soldiers is no Overt-Act?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>There is no poſitive proof of any Troop, or any Arms.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>It is proved there were Arms ſent by you at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt to Mr. <hi>Haywoods, Chernock</hi>'s Brother-in-Law, and theſe lay there till <hi>Aſhwedneſday</hi> laſt, after your Name was in the Proclamation, and then they were removed in the Night, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed at your Houſe, and were taken up there, and here is an Account given what Arms they were, Four dozen of Swords, Twenty five pair of Piſtols, Thirty two Carabines.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>Firſt it does not appear when theſe Arms were bought, nor for what intent they were brought from <hi>Haywoods.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>But what uſe had you, a private Man, for ſo many Arms, and then your going into <hi>Leicester-ſhire</hi> to meet ſome Gentlemen, and your giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how they ſtood affected to the King's Intereſt, whether that be underſtood for the Intereſt of King <hi>James,</hi> I muſt leave to the Jury, ſince you give us no account that you were imployed by King <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I went upon my private Occaſions, and then talk'd of News as other people do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>But when you returned back again, you declared all was well, and gave an account how perſons were diſpos'd in the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>North.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>Is there any perſons named, or particulars? Can it be an Overt-Act of Treaſon for me to diſcover my acquaintance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>But your going with that deſign to engage in an intereſt againſt the King, and for the late King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>He does not ſay diſcovered my deſign. I went to meet with ſome Friends of my own.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>Did not he tell you he was to go into <hi>Leicester-Shire?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sweet,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he did ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>Did he tell you to what purpoſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sweet,</speaker>
               <p>He ſaid he was to go to meet ſome of the King's Friends.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>Did I tell you who?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sweet,</speaker>
               <p>No.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>But there was a Lord's Brother, what did he tell you of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sweet,</speaker>
               <p>He ſaid all things were well, and the <hi>West</hi> was as well inclined as the <hi>North.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>To what?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sweet,</speaker>
               <p>To the King's Intereſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Treby,</speaker>
               <p>You ſpoke of a Lord's Brother that was concerned?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sweet,</speaker>
               <p>He ſaid ſeveral Perſons of Quality in the <hi>West</hi> were concerned, and a Lord's Brother was among them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Juryman,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I deſire he may be ask'd, when he ſaid the King would Land, what King he meant, whether he named the Late King, or King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>Well, Anſwer that? when he Diſcourſed to you of the King's Landing, did he Name the Late King <hi>James?</hi> or did he ſay the Late King <hi>James?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Juryman,</speaker>
               <p>Was he mentioned in the Diſcourſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sweet,</speaker>
               <p>He never uſed to mention King <hi>James</hi> to me, but only the King, which I underſtood always of King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what time was it that he ſpoke of the King's Landing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:106669:16"/>
               <speaker>Sweet.</speaker>
               <p>It was about <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Therefore no other King could be meant but King <hi>James,</hi> for there was no other King to Land at that time; and he ſaid he had the King's word for it; I ſuppoſe he can't pretend he had King <hi>William</hi>'s word for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I hope, to talk of the King's Landing is no Treaſon, it is but words; if I tell an idle Story of what I think may come to paſs, ſhall that be reckoned Treaſon? Then for him to ſay, I had it from the King's own Mouth, it is impoſſible to be true, and it an Overt Act, being only Words, and cannot be reputed Treaſon. And then as to the other two Parts of the Charge, the Conſultations which my Lord of <hi>Ailsbury,</hi> and thoſe other Perſons, there is but one Witneſs, no body but <hi>Porter,</hi> neither is there any more but he for the Aſſaſſination, his Evidence is but a ſingle proof, and there ought to be two poſitive Witneſſes by the Law to each Overt Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>No, there ought to be two Witneſſes to each Species of Treaſon, that's all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>There ought to be two Witneſſes to both theſe parts of the Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt tell you, Sir <hi>Willian Parkyns,</hi> If any perſon does Deſign and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive that the Realm ſhould be Invaded, or the King Depoſed, and another ſet upon the Throne, that Conſpiring to Invade the Realm, or Depoſe the King are Overt Acts of High Treaſon, within the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and the ſame Species of Treaſon as deſigning to Aſſaſſinate him is. It is Compaſſing, Deſigning, Imagining his Death, and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now the Queſtion is, Whether there is not another Witneſs, beſides Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> to prove another Over Act of this Deſign.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I don't find there is, for all the reſt is only Diſcourſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, for what do you think providing Arms for that purpoſe is only Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>The Witneſſes don't ſay, for what purpoſe the Arms were bought.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Nor do you tell us of any other purpoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it does not appear when they were bought.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but what occaſion had you for ſuch a quantity of Arms?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I did not buy them after all. I found them, if I had had liberty to have ſent down for Witneſſes. I could have proved, that theſe Arms were in Boxes all Ruſty in my Houſe, when I firſt came to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Bolt.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but why were they buried, juſt at the time when the Plot was broke out, and the whole Deſign diſcovered?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I can't tell, my Lord, how to help it, if they will make an ill Interpretation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>What Interpretation would you have us make?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, It is very eaſie to imagine, People don't care to be found with Arms at ſuch a time; but however the having of Arms is no Treaſon. They are as much a Commodity as any thing elſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>And then the Horſes coming to Town juſt at ſuch a time, and the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I have not bought a Horſe this two Years, and I travelled in no other manner than I uſed to do. So the Groom tells ye, I uſed to come to Town with three or four Horſes always. I never kept leſs than ſix or ſeven Horſes this twenty Years, ſometimes a great many more; and they were little Horſes, Padds, no way fit for the Service they are preſumed to be for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Have you any thing more to ſay, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I hope, my Lord, as to the Aſſaſſination I am clear: Perhaps the World may imagine, I have had ſome Inclinations to King <hi>James</hi>'s Service, and perhaps they may not think amiſs; but I never did any thing, nor had an opportunity to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>God be thanked you had no opportunity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>And I hope my Life ſhall not be taken away without proof, I hope it will be rather thought, that every one ſhould be taken to be Innocent, and it ſhould better pleaſe the King, that I ſhould be acquitted, than to let me be found guilty upon ſlight Grounds, and Imaginations, of which little or nothing can be made.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>No queſtion of it, it will pleaſe the King, and every body elſe; that you ſhould be found Innocent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns..</speaker>
               <p>Then, I hope, my Lord, you will not ſtrain the Law to take away my Life; according to the Rule, That it is better five guilty Men ſhould eſcape, than one innocent Man ſuffer: For the Blood of a Man may lie upon every body, if it be cauſeleſly ſhed; and it is very ſevere to ſtrain the Law to take away any Man's Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Look ye, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> I muſt tell you, You may be under a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great miſtake; you may think it neceſſary to have two Witneſſes to every Overt Act, but that is not ſo; for if there be one Witneſs to one Overt Act, and another Witneſs to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106669:17"/> another Overt Act of the ſame Species of Treaſon; that is all that the Law requires.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Here are two Species of Treaſon, Leying War is one Specie, and Aſſaſſination is another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Your Deſign was Originally, the Reſtoring of King <hi>James,</hi> and in order to that the Dethroning of King <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>That appears but by one Witneſs which is not according to Law, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires two.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>One way of effecting your Deſign was by Aſſaſſination, the other by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, or by Force.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Still, my Lord, here is the ſame Witneſs, and that is but one:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, there are two.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>None but Capt. <hi>Porter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

               <p>In what Particulars, my Lord?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Your providing Arms, and going to <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> and ſending <hi>Charnock</hi> on that Errand into <hi>France.</hi> As to the Aſſaſſination, indeed there is but one poſitive Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beſides other Circumſtances which have their weight, but as to the other, you ſaid the King would come.—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>It was my Opinion, that's all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>But you ſaid you had his word for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Does not that Anſwer it ſelf, my Lord? is it poſſible it ſhould be true, that I who was in <hi>England</hi> ſhould have the word of one that is at ſuch a diſtance beyond Sea?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>And then your buying of Saddles, for what purpoſe were they?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, does he ſay it was in order to it? I am ſure he does not, and I hope I ſhall not be preſum'd out of my Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>When you talkt of the King's Landing, and ſaid, you had his word for it; you likewiſe ſaid, your Troop was made up of old Soldiers, beſides Voluntiers that had been Officers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Still there is nothing done; he does not ſay, there was one Man raiſed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>And your going into <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> upon ſuch an Errand, as you told him you went upon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Well, my Lord, I muſt leave it to your Lordſhip. I hope you will conſider well of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>We muſt do that which is right between the King and his Subjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>And, I hope, my Lord, the Converſion of Subjects is more acceptable than the Deſtruction of them; and the Governement is more concern'd to ſave the Innocent, than to ſtretch the Law to puniſh Guilty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>It will be more acceptable, and indeed the King and Kingdom are very much concerned in this matter, and at this time, Sir <hi>William,</hi> and the Government ought to take care to preſerve it ſelf. Have you any more to ſay, Sir, if you have, pray ſpeak it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I have no more. I ſubmit it to your Lordſhip: I think there is but one Witneſs, and all the other is but Conjecture and Nonſence; and one Witneſs is not ſufficient, by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> for by the Statute there muſt be two.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>I have told you my Opinon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Beſides, your Lordſhip has knowm me this many Years, and you know that my Education was not to War, and Fighting, but the Gown; and your Lordſhip knows how peaceably I have lived.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>I have known you heretofore, Sir <hi>William,</hi> while you kept your Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and your Gown.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>And now in my old Age, my Lord, I am grown Lame, and loſt the uſe of my Hands with the Gout, and ſcarce able almoſt to go on my Feet. Therefore it cannot in reaſon be thought probable, that I ſhould engage in ſuch a buſineſs as this; and therefore I hope you will interpret all things in a milder Sence, in favour of Life, rather than for the deſtruction of it, and the ruine of a Man's Fortune and Family.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you, You have had my Opinion cocerning the number of Witneſſes. I ſuppoſe, my Lord and Borther will declare theirs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord Chief Juſtice, it ſeems, does pleaſe to have us deliver our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; I think we ought to be very tender in a Caſe of Blood: I think the life of Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> is at ſtake, and we ought to be carefull that he have no wrong done him: but I think in the Caſes of Treaſon, eſpecially of this nature, the life of the King, and the lives of all the innocent People of the Kingdom are alſo at ſtake; and we muſt be indifferent in this caſe, and by the Grace of God we will be ſo. The Queſtion that Sir <hi>W. Parkyns</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106669:17"/> is, Whether there are two Witneſſes upon this Evidence, to this matter of which he is indicted, which is, the Compaſſing and Imagining the King's Death. One Witneſs, at leaſt, does poſitively prove, that you Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> did agree to the Deſign of aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinating the King's perſon, and promiſe to provide and contribute Horſes and Arms to that purpoſe. Now ſuppoſe this is proved but by one Witneſs, and the Evidence had gone no further, then your Objection would have had a very good ground, that this could not be a legal Proof of Treaſon; but I muſt tell you, that this Treaſon of Compaſſing and Imagining the King's Death may be made evident by other Overt-Acts, beſides that of Aſſaſſination: To conſpire with a foreign Prince, to invade the Realm, to provide Arms, to joyn with Invaders, and to make an Inſurrection againſt the King, theſe are Overt-Acts of Imagining the King's Death. For it cannot be ſuppoſed, but that he that would have an Invaſion and an Inſurrection againſt the King's Perſon, does intend the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King; he that would take away all his Defence, which he might have by the Aſſiſtance of his Subjects, and leave him expoſed to his mortal Enemies, cannot but be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to deſign the King's Ruin and Murder. Therefore, Sir <hi>William,</hi> ſuch things being in their Nature a Compaſſing and Imagining the King's Death; your providing Arms and a Troop are Evidences and Overt-Acts of this Treaſon; and ſo will your going up and down and meeting People in order to riſe, if that were your buſineſs in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> &amp;c. as it ſeems by the Evidence it was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>But that is not ſaid, my Lord, I humbly beg your pardon for interrupting you; it is not ſaid, That I met them to riſe, by no Evidence whatſoever, and therefore, pray my Lord, do not inforce it beyond what the Evidence has proved; he ſaid, I went to meet my Friends: was there any thing ſaid, it was in order to a Riſing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>I think you miſtake your own words, as you ſpoke them to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if I did take them, as I think I did right, for they were ſeveral times repeated. I will do you no wrong, Sir <hi>William,</hi> I aſſure you. You went into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and you ſay, It was to meet your Friends, the Witneſs ſays, It was to meet the King's Friends: by the King, it is very plain, you meant not King <hi>William,</hi> but King <hi>James;</hi> for you ſpoke before of the King's Landing, which was at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, when every body knows King <hi>William</hi> was in <hi>Fngland.</hi> Theſe coupled together—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>I beg your Pardon, my Lord; thoſe two things are not both to be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the diſcourſe of the King's landing was at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> as he ſays, the other thing, my Journey into <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> was a Month afterwards, and therefore they cannot be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>The coupling of them, that I meant, was only to ſhew who was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be ſpoken of by you, when you named the King; ſo the Qucſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you did not mean the ſame perſon in <hi>January</hi> that you meant in <hi>December,</hi> by the word King, eſpecially ſince as a Diſcovery you had made, you ſaid further, that the <hi>Weſt</hi> was as well inclined to the King's Intereſt as the <hi>North,</hi> and a Lord's Brother was concerned in it. If by the King, you had meant, King <hi>William;</hi> how impertinent and inſenſible had been all this Diſcourſe, that the <hi>Weſt</hi> was as well inclined as the <hi>North,</hi> and that a Lord's Brother was concerned in it; concerned in what? In being inclined to King <hi>William,</hi> to what purpoſe could that be ſaid?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>It may as well be interpreted that way as the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt leave that to the Jury. And I confeſs, if there were not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in the caſe, you might the better argue upon this, as to the Interpretation. But laying aſide the conſideration of your riding into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> &amp;c. here is this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Arms, proved by 4 or 5 Witneſſes, and the ſerving of them in that manner; and there is no account given by you, that they were provided for the ſervice of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that you were imployed ſo to do. Certainly it is not lawfull to provide Arms, eſpecially for a whole Troop, as for ought I perceive here was, tho' indeed I am not skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough in thoſe buſineſſes, to know how many make up a Troop: but it's plain here was an Inſurrection intended, when the Invaſion was made; and that is an Evidence, that theſe Arms were to be imployed upon that account, for no other uſe was to be made of them, nor is pretended. If you had found thoſe Arms in your Houſe (as you ſay) it had been your Duty to have delivered them up, or diſpoſed of them to the Uſe and Service of the Government, which ſervice too, could only be when you had a Commiſſion from the Government, and not of your own head. And then, beſides all this, you acknowledg'd that you had a Troop of old Soliders.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>It is but ſlidingly that, for he only tells you, that a Troop would be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of old Soldiers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>How can that be? when he ſays, he repeats your own words, My Troop conſiſts of old Soldiers; can any body ſay, that his Troop conſiſts of old Soldiers, without having a Troop.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106669:18"/>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> ſpeak, my life is at ſtake, did I ſay to you, it did conſiſt, or it was to conſiſt, recollect your ſelf, and conſider well before you ſpeak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>What was it that he did ſay? it did conſiſt, or it would conſiſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sweet.</speaker>
               <p>He ſaid his Troop was compoſed all of old Soldiers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>But does it appear by any Evidence, that I had a Troop; if I had, who were they? none of theſe Men do appear. Does this Troop conſiſt of Men in the Air<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I ſhould liſt Men that are all <hi>in Nubibus,</hi> and not one of them to be known. Suppoſe I ſhould tell him a Lie or make ſome Brags, is this Treaſon, here is no perſon proved to be liſted or named.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>But Arms were found in your houſe for a Troop.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>But where they were bought, and when they were bought and made ready, it does not appear; and I affirm to your Lordſhip, if you would give me but one Days time, I would prove, that they were at my Houſe at <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> when I firſt came down thither, which is too years ago. And I'll fully make it out to your Satisfaction, or I'll be crucified or any thing in the World. I can prove it by a great many Witneſſes, by my Friends, and all the Servants that belonged to me, they were there long before this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was had or thought off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Juſtice Rokeby.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>If your Lordſhip expects that I ſhould deliver my opinion, I am ready to do it. As to this matter of Law that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> has propoſed, he ſays, There are not two Witneſſes to the ſame Over-Act, and therefore no Evidence of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; truly, I take it, and always did, that the Law is, there need not be two Witneſſes to the ſame Overt-Act; but if there be two Witneſſes, one whereof ſpeaks to one Overt-Act, and another to another Overt-Act of the ſame Species of Treaſon, theſe are two Witneſſes within the Law. Now I think, there are two Overt-Acts in the Indictment of this Treaſon. The Treaſon is compaſſing the Death of the King; the Overt-Acts are firſt the particular Deſign of the Aſſaſſination upon his perſon, and the other is the bringing in of a foreign Force, and preparing Horſes and Arms to meet that foreign Force here: all this to the ſame Intent and Purpoſe, the compaſſing and imagining the King's Death. Now beſides that of the Aſſaſſination, there are a great many Witneſſes that prove there were Arms prepared; for there are found a great Quantity, when they open'd the Boxes, which Boxes, it is plain, he himſelf ſent down to <hi>Haywood's</hi> Houſe: For tho' <hi>Charnock</hi> writ a Letter, yet it was by his Direction, as he own'd to <hi>Haywood,</hi> when he was here in Town. And then his Servant fetch'd them away from this place, and this I take to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Overt-Act, and proved by ſeveral Witneſſes. Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> ſpeaks of his being a Gown-man, but I do not know what a Gown-man has to do with ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Arms.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>If you will give me leave to ſend for ſome People, I will demonſtrate it to you as clear as the Sun, that they were in the Houſe two years ago, when I came firſt thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>There were preparations two years ago, it appears for the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the King and Kingdom, how ever the Men that were accuſed of it, had the luck to eſcape and be acquitted.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>No, but there is another Satute of the 5th. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. that may be more for your advantage, will you have that read?</p>

               <speaker>Parkins.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, if you pleaſe, I know there is another Statute that does direct it, and I expected to have found it in this Statute.</p>

               <p>I ſhall leave it to the Jury, whether this Evidence does not prove an Overt-Act, to demonſtrate a Deſign againſt the King; if the Deſign be to depoſe him, and that's manifeſted by two Overt-Acts, and undoubtedly that is Treaſon within the Statute of 25. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>

               <p>Suppoſe dethroning the King be the main deſign that ſtrikes at his Life, and you reſolve it ſhall be done one way or other. One way by Aſſaſſination, the other by Inſurrection; or by Invaſion and joyning with a Foreign Army.</p>

               <speaker>Park.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I conceive there ought to be two Witneſſes for each.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>No, no; for that very laſt Act that is to take effect in a few days, declares it is ſufficient if there be one to one Overt Act, and another to another, but ſtill it muſt be of the ſame head or ſpecies of Treaſon; and depoſing the King, and aſſaſſinating of him, and preparing to raiſe an Army againſt him, or to excite an Invaſion, are but one ſort of Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Park.</speaker>
               <p>It may be ſo, if they were Overt Acts of one ſort of Treaſon; but riſing in Arms, and Aſſaſſination are as different things as can be in the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ought to be two Witneſſes to each of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Rookby.</speaker>
               <p>That which I delivered as my opinion was, that one Witneſs proving one Overt Act, and another Witneſs proving another Overt Act of the ſame ſort of Treaſon are two good Witneſſes, according as the Law requires. And I am the more fully confirmed in it, by the Clauſe that is in this new Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made for Tryals in Caſes of Treaſon, that a man ſhall not be convicted of Treaſon, but by and upon the Oaths and Teſtimony of two lawful Witneſſes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both of them to the ſame Overt Act, or one of them to one, and the other of them to another Overt Act of the ſame Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Of the ſame Treaſon, aye.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Rookby,</speaker>
               <p>And here it is the imagining the Death of the King, that is the Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Then you may ſay every thing elſe is ſo; but if you pleaſe to let the whole Statute be read.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>You ſhall have it read if you will; but this is all that is in it concerning this matter. Now a deſign to depoſe the King, which manifeſted by ſome Overt Act, is an Overt Act to prove the deſign of the Death of the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Then it muſt be manifeſt, and not by Interpretation; and all theſe things are by Interpretation, except it be what <hi>Porter</hi> ſwears.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>If by Overt Act it be proved, that you deſigned his Depoſition, that is an Overt Act to prove your deſign of his Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>They are very different things, Death and Depoſitions. We have ſeen a King depoſed, and yet he is alive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſure we have ſeen a King agreed to be aſſaſſinated, and yet, God be thanked, he is alive ſtill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>It is not the ſucceeding in the Deſign, but the Deſign it ſelf that is the Treaſon. God forbid that it ſhould have Succeſs to make it Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>But whenever people will agree together to bring in Foreign Forces, or to prepare Men and Arms againſt the King that is in Poſſeſſion, this is reckoned an Overt Act of a Deſign againſt his Life, and has always been reckoned ſo by my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke,</hi> and by all thoſe Men that have been reputed, the moſt tender in Caſes of this nature: For any Act that expreſſes an intent of dethroning the King, by means of an Invaſion by a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Force, and an Inſurrection againſt the King, is a proper proof of a Deſign of his Deſtruction; and if not, then agreeing to ſhoot him is not an Overt Act. Men may ſay alſo, but there need be actual Shooting to make out the Overt Act in that caſe.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. J. Rokeby.</speaker>
               <p>I believe if you look into the great Caſe in Parliament, the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> you'll find it was declared for Law, that one Witneſs to one Overt Act, and another Witneſs to another Overt Act of the ſame Treaſon, they were two Witneſſes within the Law, and this was a ſolemn reſolution in Parliament in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkins.</speaker>
               <p>I believe it has been done; but here is a beneficial Law made, which if my Tryal had been put off a few days, I ſhould have had the benefit of.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. H.</speaker>
               <p>It would have been the ſame thing as to this matter, for this Act declares the very ſame thing, as to the two Witneſſes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkins.</speaker>
               <p>And then my Lord, I could have had Witneſſes to have taken off a great part of this Evidence, and the Law comes to take effect within one day, and it turns here upon this matter of <hi>Sweet</hi> who is not a good Evidence, for it is manifeſt he has contradicted himſelf, and it is manifeſt he has ſworn what cannot be true.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. J. Rokeby.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Council for the King in this matter, and it is my turn to ſumm up the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence againſt the Priſoner at the Bar. He ſtands Indicted for compaſſing the Death of the King, for deſigning to depoſe the King, for promoting a foreign Invaſion, for intending an Inſurrection here at home, and for aiding and abetting the Kings Enemies, and for doing what he could to procure the ſubjection of his own Country to Foreigners and Strangers.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, ſome of theſe Crimes run into one another; deſigning the Death of the King by Aſſaſſination, and deſigning to depoſe the King amount to one and the ſame thing, with Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of the King.</p>
               <p>My Lords, the Judges have given you their opinion in that point of Law, and I think it is agreeable to all the reſolutions that have been ſince the making of the Statute of 25 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3d. I think that it has been explained ſo in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second; but this I am ſure of, that it was ſo reſolved in the time of <hi>Harry</hi> the Fourth when there was a deſign to ſet up <hi>Richard</hi> the Second again, and it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be High Treaſon in Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of the King. For depoſing the King, is deſtroying him in his politick Capacity, as much as Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination and Murdering of him is deſtroying him in his natural Capacity, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106669:19"/> the Conſpirators in ſuch Caſes know what the great end is they aim at, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Government as it is eſtabliſhed by Law, whereby every man enjoys his own property, and the freedom of his perſon, and thoſe that will be quiet may have their liberty and property preſerved intire to them, but ſome people are ſo very impatient of ſubmitting to the Law, that they cannot be content to be in ſervitude themſelves, but they muſt needs do all they can to bring it upon their fellow Subjects. And it were very well if that thoſe who are in love with ſlavery would but go to ſome other places where they may have enough of it, and not bring it upon thoſe who are ſo little deſirous of ſuch a thing, as we are and I hope ſhall always be.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, to prove Sir <hi>Wm. Parkins</hi> guilty of this Treaſon whereof he ſtands indicted, we have produced ſeveral Witneſſes: and firſt there is Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and he tells you Sir <hi>Wm. Parkins</hi> told him he had ſeen a Commiſſion from King <hi>James</hi> written with his own hand for making War againſt the perſon of King <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Sir I beg your pardon for intetrupting you, but there was not one word of that ſaid, here is Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> pray ask him, if ever I ſaw a Commiſſion from King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. H.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Porter</hi> did ſay ſo, if I remember any thing <hi>Porter</hi> ſaid, you told him you had read the Commiſſion, and it was written with his own hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parkins.</speaker>
               <p>All that I heard of it was, that when I was deſired to make one in the Aſſaſſination, I refuſed it becauſe I ſaid I was buſy about the matter of my Regiment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray call <hi>Porter</hi> again. (Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> came in)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> will you give the Court and the Jury an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what you heard Sir <hi>Wm. Parkins</hi> ſay, about the Commiſſion that came from King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap. Porter.</speaker>
               <p>I askt Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> why I might not ſee the Commiſſion, and he told me he had never ſeen it himſelf, but Sir <hi>Wm. Parkins</hi> had. I did ask Sir <hi>Wm. Parkins</hi> whether he had ſeen it, and he told me he did ſee it and read it, and it was to raiſe War againſt the Perſon of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. Porter.</speaker>
               <p>It was all written with King <hi>James</hi>'s own hand.</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap. Porter.</speaker>
               <p>We uſed to ſay amongſt our ſelves it was, becauſe he would not truſt any of his Miniſters with it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I would not do Sir <hi>Wm. Parkins</hi> any wrong, but only ſumm up what is material in the Evidence given againſt him. I remember very well Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> told him Sir <hi>Wm. Parkins</hi> had ſeen the Commiſſion, but I would not offer that as Evidence againſt the Priſoner what another told him, but he ſays beſides that Sir <hi>Wm. Parkins</hi> told him himſelf, that he had ſeen it, and that it was written with King <hi>James</hi>'s own hand. He ſays that they had ſeveral Meetings together, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> and a great many others; and he names the places, the <hi>Naggs Head</hi> in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and the <hi>Globe</hi> Tavern in <hi>Hatton Garden;</hi> he tells you particularly, that it was agreed that <hi>King</hi> (who was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted) and <hi>Knightly,</hi> and himſelf ſhould go and view a place that ſhould be proper for the Aſſaſſination, and to give a Report to the Priſoner, and the reſt of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, what they thought the moſt proper place; and that accordingly they did view the place, and came home at night, and met the Company, whereof Sir <hi>Wm. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyns</hi> was one; and they gave an account how the place was viewed, and which was thought moſt proper, and then all the Company agreed to it. He ſays indeed, that Sir <hi>Wm.

Upon the <hi>Friday</hi> afterwards, the day before the diſcovery, then there were 4 Horſes brought to Town, and a 5th was borrowed of Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> which was a Roan Gelding.</p>

               <speaker>Parkyns.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, will you pleaſe to obſerve what ſort of Horſes they were; and particularly the heighth of them, that it may be known how fit they were for this buſineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I will do you no wrong, Sir <hi>William,</hi> if I can help it. The Jury have heard the Evidence; and by and by they will hear my Lords Directions: but they do ſay there were 4 brought to Town, and a fifth was ſent, a Roan Gelding; firſt the Witneſs ſaid the Horſe came from <hi>Mountague</hi> Houſe, but then preſently he recollected himſelf, and acknowledged the miſtake; and afterwards ſaid it was from <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe. So there were the 5 Horſes, 3 whereof Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was to mount, and 2 Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> as he himſelf ſays; and theſe Facts I inſtance in as making a concurring Evidence, and very near to two Witneſſes to prove this part of the Conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, Captain <hi>Porter</hi> goes further, and ſays, that he had heard (but Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> did not tell him ſo himſelf) that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe, and was preparing ſo to do, againſt the time of the Invaſion, to joyn with the Forces that were to come from abroad. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm which we have called Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> to give you an account, that he had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Sir <hi>Wm. Parkyns</hi> for 3 years, and that he had often talkt with him about the King, that is his preſent Majeſty, whom he called the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the little Gentleman; and about King <hi>James,</hi> whom he uſed to call always the King; and he ſaid the King was to land very ſpeedily, and that he had a Troop which conſiſted of old Soldiers, and that there were ſeveral Volunteers that were Officers; he ſaid he was to take a Journey into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and accordingly he went; and when he returned back again he ſaid, the Weſt and the North were very well inclined to the King's Intereſt, or to that purpoſe. And to ſtrengthen his Evidence we prove, that he did go accordingly into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and we prove it by his Servant that went with him, where he met with ſeveral perſons, particularly one <hi>Yarborough</hi> and a Parſon; what they did tranſact the Servant cannot prove, but he is a concurring Witneſs to prove, that he went into <hi>Leiceſterſhire;</hi> and we have all the reaſon in the world to believe that he went on that Errand that he ſpoke of before, that is to meet the Kings Friends, as he called King <hi>James.</hi> And then there is a further concurring Evidence of his having a Regiment, or a Troop, it is not material whether it be one or the other; and that is the matter of the Arms, 4 dozen of Swords, 32 Carbines, 35 Caſes of Piſtols, that were hid in the Garden of his Houſe; and theſe Arms we have traced further, he ſent them from his Houſe to <hi>Haywoods</hi> Houſe, there he thought they would not lye ſafe, and therefore Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> ſends for them privately; they were to come away at night, and be brought back to his Houſe, and they were accordingly brought back in the night to his Houſe, and there they were buried; and the ſame perſon ſaw them taken up after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which brought them to Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> Houſe, and proves they were the ſame Boxes that were buried, and which upon opening proved to be theſe Arms that were firſt ſent to <hi>Haywoods,</hi> and afterwards brought back to his own Houſe.</p>
               <p>So that this, Gentlemen, is a concurring Evidence both to what <hi>Sweet</hi> ſays, and to what <hi>Porter</hi> ſays, and thoſe are the two Witneſſes to this part of the Treaſon, that there was a proviſion of Arms and Men for this purpoſe, which he ſaid he had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, againſt all this he makes but a very ſmall Objection. As to the matter of the two VVitneſſes to every Overt Act, that has been over-ruled by the Court; and as to the Arms, he ſays he found them at his Houſe when he firſt came to it; and then they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106669:20"/> were old ruſty Arms, but of this he gives you no manner of Evidence. But if they were there when he came to the Houſe, How came he at this time of Day to hide them, and ſecret them? Why might they not be as publick now as they were before he came, which he has had time enough to prepare to prove ſince the finding of them? And he does not give you ſo much as any colourable Reaſon why he ſo ſecreted them. And therefore it is a moſt juſt and violent Suſpicion that they were for the purpoſes that the Witneſſes have given you an account of; and you have reaſon to believe they were provided for to arm that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, which he was to raiſe to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> when they came to land here. So that if you believe what the Witneſſes have Sworn, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, but that he is Guilty of the Treaſon charged upon him; and we doubt not you'll find him ſo.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Cooper.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; I am of the ſame ſide of Counſel for the King. Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> has given us a good Caution, which I ſhall take care to obſerve; and that is, not to ſtrain either Fact, or Law, to his prejudice. But, my Lord, When ſuch a Matter as this, a Crime of this nature, is ſo far proved againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, that no body can in his private Judgment reaſonably acquit him; then I think it a good piece of Service to the Publick to make the Matter ſo plain, that it may be put beyond all manner of Doubt, both for the eaſe of the Jurors, and for the ſatisfaction of all others that hear this Tryal.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> has truly divided his Indictment into two Parts, the one that accuſes him of being concerned in the Aſſaſſination, and the other that accuſes him of being concerned in Inviting the <hi>French</hi> into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Ingaging to meet them with an armed Force.</p>
               <p>My Lord, As to the firſt part, I muſt do Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> that Right, that there is but one poſitive Evidence as to the Aſſaſſination; but that Evidence tells ye he agreed to it at ſeveral Meetings; nay, that he was one who ſaid it was neceſſary to be done, in order to the other Deſign he was Ingaged in, the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litating the Landing of the <hi>French,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> his Deſcent and Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. There is, I ſay indeed, but one Witneſs of that Matter, but the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that one Witneſs is confirmed by many concurring Circumſtances; by his ſending for Horſes to Town the Day before the firſt <hi>Saturday,</hi> when this Exercrable Treaſon was to have been Executed; by ſending them out of Town again that Day upon the Diſappointment; by ſending for them again the Friday before the ſecond Saturday that the King was to have been Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; by his having more Horſes than were uſual with him that Day; by his taking care then of three Horſes that were none of his own, and one of them brought very ſuſpiciouſly from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe;</hi> and that all theſe eight Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould be immediately hurried and carried away upon the Diſappointment the ſecond Saturday, and nothing ever heard of them afterwards. I ſay one of them was brought very ſuſpiciouſly; for, my Lord, you obſerve it came from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and ſent by <hi>Lewis</hi> according to the Priſoner's Promiſe to Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> which <hi>Lewis,</hi> it is apparent by all the Witneſſes of this Matter, was privy to this Deſign.</p>
               <p>My Lord, There is another Circumſtance beſides this, which, I think, has not been obſerved, and that is, his ſending for <hi>Sweet</hi> up to Town before the ſecond time that the King was to have been Aſſaſſinated; he came up indeed before both the times: The firſt time he was told by the Priſoner, he had once deſigned to have uſed him in a Buſineſs; but upon ſecond Thoughts he had Compaſſion for his Family. And when he came the ſecond time, he was firſt ask'd what Condition he had left his Family in, whether he had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them Money. He ſaid, No; and thereupon new as Chid: And the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſaid, he might then as well have ſtaid at home. All theſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106669:21"/> beſides the one poſitive Evidence, ſavour ſtrongly of his having a great Hand in the Deſign of Aſſaſſinating the King.</p>
               <p>But then, my Lord, As to the other Part; his Inviting the <hi>French,</hi> and preparing to meet them, that is poſſitively proved by two Witneſſes. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Porter</hi> tells you, That the Priſoner was at the two Meetings in <hi>Leaden-hall-ſtreet,</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi>'s-<hi>ſtreet,</hi> where it was expreſly reſolved by all that were preſent, and the Priſoner among the reſt, to ſend <hi>Chernock</hi> over to invite the French to invade this Kingdom, and to promiſe to meet King <hi>James</hi> at his Landing with Two Thouſand Horſe. He Swears, That Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> did particularly agree to what was ſo Reſolved upon at both the Conſults. And <hi>Sweet</hi> tells you that he had prepared for the ſame Deſign; for that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> told him, the King would Land, he had his Word for it; and he himſelf had a Troop of Old Soldiers. <hi>My Troop does conſiſt</hi> (he ſpoke it in the preſent Tenſe; for it being a Doubt Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> did himſelf that Right as to examine the Witneſs again, and he repeated it as his Words, <hi>My Troop conſiſts) of Old Soldiers, or is compoſed of Old Soldiers.</hi> And he was to have ſeveral Volunteers that had been Officers.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Theſe Two poſitive Witneſſes are Evidence that goes to the ſame Species of Treaſon, nay to the ſame Deſign, the raiſing a Rebellion, and the Depoſing the King, which is Killing him in his politick Capacity; I ſay, theſe Two go home to the ſame Deſign.</p>
               <p>And, my Lord, This Evidence upon this branch of the Indictment, is corroborated too by very ſtrong Circumſtances. There is a Journey to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> which <hi>Sweet</hi> ſpeaks of, that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> told him he would undertake: This Journey it is proved by his Servant that he did undertake; that he met there with ſeveral Perſons, and came back and made his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to <hi>Sweet</hi> of the Succeſs of his Journey, and how well Diſpoſed the King's Friends were, by which Name he always meant King <hi>James;</hi> for when he ſpoke of our preſent King he called him the <hi>Little Gentleman,</hi> or ſometimes King <hi>William,</hi> and ſometimes, as the Witneſs at laſt ſaid poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> But when he ſpoke of the King, without any thing elſe, he always meant King <hi>James;</hi> and beſides, he ſpoke of a King that was beyond Sea at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, which could not be King <hi>William,</hi> who was then, and had been in <hi>England</hi> ſo long before.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the Priſoner in his Defence ſays, That this Servant of his that went with him into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> had been formerly <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Servant, and was ſent by <hi>Chernock</hi> with the Meſſage to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> and not by him. Yet I muſt obſerve, that the Evidence ſwore poſitively he was ſent by Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> his Maſter, and brought the Note in the Almanack back to the Perſon to whom he was directed to carry it, who lodged at the Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners Houſe; and when he had ſo done, that the Perſon that Lodged at the Confectioners did not remit him to <hi>Chernock,</hi> but to his Maſter Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parkyns,</hi> with a Meſſage that he would be at Home, and ſtay there ready whenever he ſhould have occaſion for him; and this was upon the very Saturday the King was to have been Aſſaſſinated.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> has complained, that if he could have had his Evidence here, he could have proved the Arms had been two years in his Houſe, and that he found them there when he came thither firſt. If we ſhould admit that Matter; we might Confeſs, and avoid it; for it is apparent, that theſe Arms were on this Occaſion put up in a ſuſpicious manner in Boxes, and ſent to <hi>Haywood</hi>'s, (who is a Suſpicious Perſon by reaſon of his Relation to <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> upon whoſe Letter and Recommendation they were received) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed till the Plot was diſappointed; and then they were carried away from that place, and buried in Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>'s own Garden. This was juſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106669:21"/> the breaking out of the Plot; and they were buried for the better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them as choice Goods. And whereas the Priſoner ſays they were old and ruſty when he found them, it now appears they were clean and new-furbiſh'd Arms, and the Hilts were off the Swords, and pack'd together.</p>
               <p>My Lord, he has Recourſe to another Argument in the laſt Place, the moſt moving, I muſt confeſs, of all; and that is the Argument of Pity: He has ſpoke of his Education in the Profeſſion of the Gown, of his Infirmities, his Age, and his Family. Arguments of Pity I am very unfit to give an Anſwer to, and ſhould be very unwilling to extinguiſh any Motions of it; but this I muſt obſerve even by way of Anſwer to that Argument, That the Time was when he ſhould have pittied himſelf, and not engaged in ſuch an Abominable and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Deſign; That he ſhould have had Pity upon his Countrey, which he Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bring under the greateſt Confuſion and Deſolation; That he ſhould have had Pity upon the beſt of Kings, and the beſt of Men; but then there was no Pity, when they thought they had laid their Deſigns ſo that they had him in their Power, but they reſolved Barbarouſly to murder him, and perſiſted in the Reſolution of Aſſaſſinating him after they were once Diſappointed: That it ſeems did not diſcourage them, but they undertook it a Second Time, and it does not appear that they ever had any Remorſe at laſt for it; but the Plot broke out, and ſo their whole Deſign was fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>My Lord, This is the Sum, I think, of his Defence; I have as well as I was able given an Anſwer to the Objections made to it, and I muſt now leave it with you Gentlemen of the Jury: And though theſe Conſiderations that I have mentioned may not quite remove all Compaſſion, yet they may ſerve to confirm you in a Reſolution of doing the King, and Kingdom, and your Selves Juſtice; and that is all we ask of you.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> is Indicted of High Treaſon, for Deſigning, Imagining and Compaſſing the Death of the preſent King.

                  </gap> the beginning of <hi>June</hi> laſt, there was a meeting of diver. Perſons at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ngs-Head Tavern in <hi>Leaden-Hall-ſtreet</hi> in the City, where they dined together, and there was Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Captain <hi>Porter</hi> himſelf, Sir <hi>John Fenwick,</hi> Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and divers others that he has mentioned to you. At that meeting they did conſult together, which way the late King <hi>James</hi> might be Reſtored, and it was thought very neceſſary that there ſhould be a French Force ſent over hither to join with others for his Reſtoration. And they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves agree, and determine what number of Forces might be convenient for that Purpoſe, they did propoſe Ten Thouſand, Eight Thouſand Foot, One Thouſand Horſe, and One Thouſand Dragoons: And that a Meſſage ſhould be ſent over to King <hi>James,</hi> to perſwade him to ſollicit the French King, to furniſh him with ſuch a Number of Men to be ſent over into <hi>England.</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> that was then in the Company, and was the Perſon agreed upon among them to be the Meſſenger to be ſent upon this Errand, which Imployment he did undertake, upon their Promiſe, that they would raiſe among themſelves Two Thouſand Horſe for to meet the late King at his Landing.</p>
               <p>This being at that time determined, and Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> having accepted this Imployment, he did make preparation to go upon this Errand. In ſome time after, (a Week, or a Fortnight, or thereabouts) there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meeting at which were ſeveral of the ſame Perſons, that were preſent at the former, and among them Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was one: And this Meeting was at one Mrs. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s, that keeps a Tavern in St. <hi>James</hi>'s
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106669:22"/> 
                  <hi>ſtreet,</hi> where they did diſcourſe of what they had formerly agreed upon; and did again conſider whether they ſhould proceed to ſend Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> with that Meſſage; to which they all agreed that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> ſhould go, and he accordingly went; and Captain <hi>Porter</hi> met him about five or ſix Weeks after the Meeting at Mrs. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s, and <hi>Chernock</hi> told him he had been in <hi>France,</hi> and that ſince his return he had been with the ſeveral perſons who had ſent him, and had acquainted them with the Anſwer of King <hi>James,</hi> which was, that at that Juncture of time the <hi>French</hi> King had ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his Forces, that he could not then ſpare them, or furniſh him with ſo many to come over here. This is the firſt matter that <hi>Porter</hi> gives you an account of.</p>
               <p>But then Captain <hi>Porter</hi> tells you further, how the Deſign of Aſſaſſinating the King was ſet on foot about the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>February</hi> laſt. About which time Sir <hi>George Barckley</hi> was ſent over with a Commiſſion from the late King <hi>James;</hi> which ſeems to have given great incouragement to that Party of Men; for Sir <hi>George Barckley,</hi> Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> with divers others, had ſeveral Meetings at the Globe Tavern in <hi>Hutton Garden,</hi> the Nags Head Tavern in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> the Sun Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and other places. And at theſe Meetings they entred into Conſideration, what was the beſt way to Reſtore the late King <hi>James</hi> to the Throne; and it was agreed among them. King <hi>William,</hi> which they reſolved to undertake; and at theſe Debates and Reſolutions, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, was preſent. Captain <hi>Porter</hi> being askt whether Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> at theſe Conſults, did conſent to the King's Murder, he ſaid they did all agree to the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the King, and Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> ſaid he thought it was very neceſſary to be done, to facilitate the Reſtoration of the late King.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This Deſign of the Aſſaſſinating the King being thus Reſolved upon; the next thing Conſidered among them was, how it might be effected; there were ſeveral ways propoſed: one was by an Ambuſcade; for the King having a Houſe in the Country by <hi>Richmond,</hi> His Majeſty uſed to go once a Week a Hunting thereabout, and to return at night; and therefore an Ambuſcade on that ſide of the Water near the Houſe was propoſed: then another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was made to fall upon the Guards on this ſide the Water, and at the ſame time that the King's Coach was to be ſet upon. And theſe two places being propoſed, there was ſome difference of Opinion among them, whereupon it was agreed that ſome Perſons ſhould be ſent to view the Ground on both ſides the Water, which Perſons were Captain <hi>Porter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> King</hi> that was Executed, and one <hi>Knightley;</hi> and ſo ſome days before the 15th. of <hi>February</hi> they did go on both ſides the Water, and viewed the Ground, and returned in the Evening to the Nags Head Tavern according to agreement, where were met together Sir <hi>George Barckley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and the Priſoner at the Bar, Sir <hi>William Parkyns.</hi> And there they made their Report done of their view of the Ground, and upon which both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals were Debated, and at laſt they did all agree that the Attack ſhould be made upon the King on this ſide of the Water, in a Lane that was between <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnham Green;</hi> and the Attack upon the Guards was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be made thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was to furniſh five Horſes, whereof three of them were to be mounted by Men of his own providing, the other two were to be mounted by Men of Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s providing, Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and one <hi>Rookwood,</hi> were to be principally ingaged in Attacking the Guards. The number of Men agreed upon for the whole, were about forty or few more, and Sir <hi>George Barckley</hi> was to have a Party out of them all, of about eight, and as thoſe others went to fall upon, and Charge the Guards, Sir <hi>George Barckley</hi> with his Party of Men, was to Attack the King in his Coach, and by ſhooting into the Coach to kill the King and all that were with him.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:106669:22"/>
               <p>The Time agreed upon for putting this deſign in Execution was on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15th. of <hi>February.</hi> That day it was expected the King wou'd go a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And Two Men were planted at <hi>Kenſington</hi> to give notice, when the King went, and upon ſuch notice, theſe Men were to March out in ſmall Parties, and to Lodge in the Inns, and Publick Houſes about <hi>Brentford,</hi> and <hi>Turnham Green,</hi> upon notice of the King's Return from the other ſide of the Water, and Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was to be in readineſs to ſet upon the Coach in the Lane; and the other Party to Attack the Guards.</p>
               <p>But this Horrid Deſign was very happily Diſcovered, which prevented the King's going abroad on that day; and though they were diſappointed for that Time, yet the Deſign was not at an end: But their Reſolutions continue to make the like Attempt when they could have an other opportunity. And for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there was another Meeting, as Captain <hi>Porter</hi> tells you, upon the <hi>Friday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing at the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> at which Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay, Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>Chernock,</hi> and Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> were preſent, and they did agree to Attack the King and the Guards, the next day in the ſame place, and manner that they had formerly agreed upon. But by good Providence the King had notice of it, ſo that he did forbear to go abroad that day, whereby theſe Conſpirators were totally diſappointed of their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and Villanous Deſign which they had reſolved upon, and had made ſuch Preparations to compaſs.</p>
               <p>It is true, Captain <hi>Porter</hi> does tell you, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was not to be one that ſhould be actually preſent at the Aſſaſſination; but he was to furniſh Five Horſes, Three of them to be mounted by Men of his own providing, and Two by Men that Captain <hi>Porter</hi> was to provide. And you are told poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> at this laſt Meeting did complain that Two of his Horſes were fallen Lame, and acquainted Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> with it, and he promiſed to help him to Two more by the means of one <hi>Lewis</hi> that was Gentleman of the Horſe to my Lord <hi>Feverſham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then you are told, that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> ſent to <hi>Sweet</hi> to come to Town the 11th. of <hi>February,</hi> and <hi>Sweet</hi> comes to Town accordingly on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 12th. of <hi>February,</hi> and then he had diſcourſe with Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> at his Lodgings, where Sir <hi>William</hi> told him, that becauſe of his Family, he would not imploy him in the buſineſs he intended for him, and therefore bid him go home again; and with all, directed him to return to Town the <hi>Fryday</hi> following: and order his Groom to bring his Horſes to Town; he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Three Horſes which ſhould be the ſtrongeſt he had, the Groom brought up the Three Horſes, and <hi>Sweet</hi> came to Town with him, and ſtaid till <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> ſaid he thought to go out of Town in the Afternoon, but did not, but ſtay'd till <hi>Monday,</hi> when he went out of Town.</p>
               <p>But upon the <hi>Friday</hi> following, the Horſes of Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> were brought to Town again, which now were Four, and were ſet up at the <hi>George</hi> Inn in <hi>Holborn;</hi> and it appears that Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> furniſhed one Horſe, for there were Five Horſes there upon the Account of Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> of which a Roan Horſe was one which came from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe.</hi> This is proved by the Hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; and that <hi>Lewis</hi> himſelf came in on <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Afternoon to inquire for Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> but he was gone and the Horſes were taken away, and he once came with Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> to the Inn. Theſe are Circumſtances. that do Concur with, and Confirm Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evidence concerning the providing Horſes for this Deſign.</p>
               <p>Then there is another Particular of Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evidence concerning the Commiſſion from King <hi>James,</hi> which is remarkable: It was told you, that he askt <hi>Chernock</hi> whether he had ſeen the Commiſſion: he ſaid no, but Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> had: and Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was askt by <hi>Porter,</hi> as they were ſitting by the fire-ſide whether he had ſeen the Commiſſion, and Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parkyns</hi> anſwered, that he had ſeen it, and had read it, and it was written with King <hi>James</hi>'s own hand; and that the Subſtance of it was to make War upon the Perſon of the Preſent King, who was called in the Commiſſion as you
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106669:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> may ſuppoſe the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> So that, Gentlemen, as to the diſcovery of the Aſſaſſinating the King, and of this Commiſſion which was underſtood by them to be for that purpoſe. This is the Summ and Subſtance of <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo attended with, and confirmed by theſe Circumſtances, as you have heard.</p>
               <p>Beſides the other Witneſs, <hi>Sweet,</hi> who was a great Acquaintance of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parkyns,</hi> tells you, That about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, he was informed by Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parkyns,</hi> That the King would land, which he underſtood to be meant of King <hi>James.</hi> He ask'd Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> how he knew it? and he ſaid, He had his Word for it; and that his Troop conſiſted of Old Soldiers, and he had Thirty Saddles; and beſides, there would be ſome Volunteers, which were Old Officers. Then he ſaid, He was to go into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and he did go with one <hi>Scudamore;</hi> and this was in <hi>January,</hi> about the latter end, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. They lay that Night at <hi>Stony-Stratford,</hi> and the next Night at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and <hi>Scudamore</hi> went with him; and afterwards one <hi>Yarborough,</hi> and a Parſon, came to him out of <hi>Yorkſhire:</hi> And when he came back he ſaid, He found all there to be very well; and the Weſt was as well incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the King's Intereſt, as the North; and a Lord's Brother was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>Then in the next place you are told, That at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> did write a Letter to one <hi>Haywood,</hi> who had married his Siſter, and lived near Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> to deſire him to receive ſome Goods into his Houſe that were to come from Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>'s, and lay them up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> for they were choice Goods, which Sir <hi>William</hi> durſt not leave in his own Houſe, becauſe he had left it. And accordingly there were theſe Boxes, and Cheſts ſent to <hi>Haywood</hi>'s, and received by him into his Houſe, where they continued till the latter end of <hi>February. Haywood</hi> about this time, when the Deſign of the <hi>Aſſaſſination</hi> was on foot, met with Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> in Town, and ask'd him how he would diſpoſe of thoſe Goods? Thereupon Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> ſent his Servant into the Country; and notice was given on <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> after the firſt Proclamation that iſſued upon the Diſcovery of this Conſpiracy, that theſe Goods ſhould be removed: And a Man, in the Evening, went to <hi>Haywood</hi>'s Houſe with a Cart and Horſes, and removed theſe Cheſts; they were Three in number; and thoſe being opened, there were Eight leſſer ones taken out, and carried away about Nine or Ten a Clock at Night, to Sir <hi>William Parkyn</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> where they were buried in the Garden, and afterward were dug up, which was at the Searching Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Houſe upon the Breaking-out of the Plot; and when they were open'd, it did appear what ſort of Goods they were: They were Arms, a conſiderable Quantity of them; Four Dozen of Swords with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hilts, Twenty five Pair of Piſtols, and a great number of Carbines, Thirty two as I remember, and a parcel of Hilts pack'd up in a Box by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This, Gentlemen, is ſworn to you by the Perſons that were preſent at the digging them up, and opening the Boxes.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, you are told, That though Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> pretends they were Arms that he found in the Houſe when he came thither, yet they were not old ruſty Arms, as he pretends, but they were very bright, and fit for Uſe and Service.</p>
               <p>There is one Circumſtance more that ſeems to affect Sir <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyns,</hi> about the Buſineſs of the Aſſaſſination; and that is proved by <hi>Eubank,</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi>'s own Servant. There was a Note ſent upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> the 22d. of <hi>February</hi> in the Morning, to one <hi>Brown,</hi> at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> by Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>'s Man; and this <hi>Brown</hi> writ in the Servant's Almanack, that he would be in Town himſelf in a little time, and bid him carry it to a Man that lodged at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioners over-againſt <hi>Grey</hi>'s-<hi>Inn</hi> Gate in <hi>Holbourn:</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyn</hi>'s Man accordingly goes to this Confectioners, and ſpeaks with the Perſon there that he was directed to go to; and he ſays he was a <hi>Scotch</hi> Man, and talk'd broad like a <hi>Scotch</hi> Man, and he bid him go and tell his Maſter, That he would ſtay within for him till he came; and he did accordingly.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106669:23"/>
               <p>Gentlemen, This is the Sum and Subſtance of the Evidence that is given againſt Sir <hi>William Parkyns.</hi> Now we are to conſider what Sir <hi>William</hi> ſays for himſelf: He does admit, and agree, That what <hi>Porter</hi> ſays is very poſitive and full; but that is but the Evidence of one Witneſs: For, ſays he, by the Law no Perſon ought to be convicted of High-Treaſon, upon the Teſtimony of one Witneſs. As to the Matter of Law he is in the right; No Man ought to be convicted of Treaſon upon the Teſtimony of a ſingle Witneſs. Now firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Deſign to Aſſaſſinate the King had not been proved; conſider then whether there be not Two Witneſſes beſides. <hi>Porter</hi> proves, That <hi>Chernock,</hi> was ſent into <hi>France</hi> by Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> and others, upon that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand; to which, if you add the Teſtimony of <hi>Sweet,</hi> that ſwears, That Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> told him the King wou'd Land, and he had a Troop, and had bought Saddles; and what is ſaid concerning his going into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and his having a Quantity of Arms: If all which be underſtood in purſuance of the Deſign againſt His preſent Majeſty, then there are at leaſt Two Witneſſes of ſeveral Overt-Acts of the ſame Treaſon.</p>
               <p>For, Gentlemen, I muſt tell you, tho' there had been no Evidence of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Aſſaſſinate the King, but the Deſign and Purpoſe had been to Depoſe him, and ſet the late King upon the Throne, or join with a Force to invade the Realm, that is High-Treaſon within the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> the Third, as being Deſigning the Death and Deſtruction of the King. There hath been a full Proof by Two Witneſſes if what <hi>Sweet,</hi> and the other Witneſſes beſides <hi>Porter</hi> ſay, doe prove Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> to be concerned in that Deſign, which ſhall be Conſidered further of by and by.</p>
               <p>But in the next place, ſuppoſe that the Meetings at the Kings-head in <hi>Leaden-Hall Street,</hi> and at <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s had not been proved: but the Deſign to Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the King is proved by one Witneſs, and the providing Men and Arms to fight againſt him is proved by one other Witneſs: This is a Proof of the ſame Treaſon; for though the Overt-acts be ſeveral, yet they both tend to the ſame end, the Deſtruction of the King, though in a different manner; and though the Law requires two Witneſſes to the ſame ſort of Treaſon, yet it does not require two Witneſſes to any one Overt-act. For if one Witneſs prove one Overt-act at one time, and another Witneſs prove ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Overt-act at another time, theſe are two Witneſſes within the meaning of the Law: and ſo it has been always practiſed, and never denied to be Law that I know of.</p>
               <p>Beſides it is obſervable upon this point, which my Brother has mentioned, that this new Act of Parliament, which does not yet take effect, provides, That there ſhall be either two Witneſſes to one Overt-act, or one Witneſs to one, and another to another of the ſame Species of Treaſon; and you have had the Opinion of all us now that are here, that theſe are Overt-acts of one and the ſame Species of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>But then Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> objects, That <hi>Sweet</hi> does not prove any Overt-act. Now for that, you are to conſider the Force of <hi>Sweet</hi>'s Evidence, who tells you the Diſcourſe of Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> about <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> laſt, of the late King's Landing, of his Saddles, and of his Troops conſiſting of Old Soldiers, and Volunteers that were Old Officers: But ſays Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> this is only Words, and Words are not Treaſon: But then conſider, that they are Words that relate to Acts and Things. You hear he had a great Quantity of Arms, beyond what he, as a private Man, could have Occaſion for, or would uſe. He does not give you any account what he was to do with thoſe Arms, or to what purpoſe ſhould he keep them, nor why he cauſed them to be removed in the night after they had lain privately in <hi>Haywood</hi>'s houſe, and cauſed them to be carried back to his own houſe, and buried them in the Ground, and at ſuch a time when there was a Plot, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Plot was diſcovered, and a Proclamation out for his own Apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>'s Diſcourſe with <hi>Sweet,</hi> of King <hi>James</hi>'s Landing, and his Troop conſiſting of ſuch Men, plainly ſhews what thoſe Arms were for.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106669:24"/> For, Gentlemen, Mens Diſcourſes, and their Words explain their Actions; and an indifferent Action may be explained by Words. It is lawful for a Man to buy a Piſtol; but if it can be plainly proved from his words, or his ſpeeches that he deſigned the uſe of it againſt the Perſon or Life of the King, that will be an Overt Act. Now when Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> ſaid, The late King would Land, and that he had a Troop which conſiſted of ſuch Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; then theſe Arms being found in that manner, I muſt leave to your Conſideration whether it is not a Proof, for what purpoſe he did provide them, and to what Uſe he intended to put them; eſpecially ſince he gives you no Account, what Uſe or Occaſion he had for them. He ſays, indeed, he found them in the houſe two years ago, how probable that is, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
               <p>Then there is another thing, his going into <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> with <hi>Scudamore</hi> and his meeting there with <hi>Yarborough</hi> and other People in that private and haſty manner. He went out on the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and come home again upon <hi>Monday</hi> Night; and then he meets with <hi>Sweet,</hi> and tells him that all was well; and the Weſt was as well inclined to the King's Intereſt as the North: What King muſt he mean? he had no Commiſſion from King <hi>William</hi> to go into <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> to diſcourſe with People, to ſee how they ſtood affected to his Intereſt. <hi>Sweet</hi> comes and tells you, that when Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> ſpoke of the King, he underſtood he meant King <hi>James.</hi> I muſt leave it to your Conſideration, how you will interpret theſe Words.</p>
               <p>It is true Gentlemen, it is not fit there ſhould be any ſtrain'd or forc'd Conſtruction put upon a Man's Words or Actions, when he's Tryed for his Life. You ought to have a full and a ſatisfactory Evidence to convince you, that he is Guilty, before you pronounce him ſo; but however you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Nature of things, and the Circumſtances that attend them. If you can ſuppoſe that he went into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> to King <hi>William</hi>'s Friends, and that he was of Opinion, the Weſt was as well Affected to King <hi>William,</hi> as the North; then you make a different Conſtruction from <hi>Sweet</hi> who tells you, that always when he ſpake of the King, he underſtood it of King <hi>James;</hi> and at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> when he ſpoke of the King's Landing, it muſt be meant King <hi>James,</hi> for King <hi>William</hi> was here before; and he pretends not he had any Authority to Raiſe a Troop for King <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Gentlemen, I muſt leave it to you upon the whole matter; if you are ſatisfied, that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> is Guilty of the Matters of which he ſtands Charged, you will find him Guilty, you have heard the Evidence, and will conſider of it, if upon the whole, you are not ſatisfied, that he is Guilty of the Matters Charged in this Indictment, then you are to acquit him.</p>
               <stage>Then an Officer being Sworn to keep the Jury according to the Cuſtom, they withdrew, to conſider of their Verdict, and in leſs then half an Hour, returned again into Court.</stage>

               <p>Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> that which you move now, is not in Arreſt of Judgment, it is matter that does ariſe upon the Evidence, and what you now ſay, Arraigns the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and the Proceedings upon your Tryal. There were Two Witneſſes againſt you, that it is plain. You were not Indicted for Levying of War, but for Compaſſing and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the Death of the King; and we told you the deſign of the Invaſion, and Conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Depoſe the preſent King, and Reſtore the late King, was an Overtact of that High Treaſon The Commiſſion was not ſo much ſtood upon; but the Advanceing Moneys upon this Account, to <hi>Blaire</hi> your Lieutenant Colonel; to give to the Men, that was a plain Overt Act, and ſo there were certainly Two Witneſſes againſt you.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. H.</speaker>
               <p>It cannot be granted; beſides the matter you now move upon, is improper it was all conſidered upon your Tryal. It was told you, we did all agree, that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to Levy War to Depoſe the King is Treaſon, or to Invade the Realm is Treaſon. All this was conſider'd at your Tryal, and that is now over.</p>

               <p>You the Priſoners at the Bar, Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> you have been Indicted for High Treaſon, in Compaſſing the Death and Deſtruction of the King: For your Tryal, you have put your ſelves upon the Country, which Country has found you Guilty. The Offence is the greateſt in the Judgment of the Law, that a Man can commit; and it is Juſtly and Reaſonably ſo. For Robbery and Murder are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to private Perſons, but Compaſſing the Death of the King, is Compaſſing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Father of your Countrey, and letting in Rapine, Death, and Deſolation, upon Thouſands of People. And even this, the Hainouſeſt of Offences, is capable of Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation; for there have been always Excuſes, and ſometimes Juſtifications for Rebellion; and as to Murder and private Revenge; there may be ſomewhat ſaid in Mitigation from the Violence of Men's Paſſions. But to Sit, and Conſpire, and Conſult, and Debate the Deſtruction of a Prince; no Man yet ever had the Confidence to make an Excuſe for it; I would not add to your Affliction: I am ſenſible of the ſevere Judgment, that is to follow, and which you have brought upon your ſelves; and cannot but Pity you for the great burden of Guilt, that you have laid your ſeves under. I only ſay this, to offer it to your ſerious Conſideration, in the few Moments you have to prepare for another World, and another Judgment. All that remains for me, is to Pronounce the Judgment of the Law in theſe Caſes, and the Court does Award it.</p>
               <q>That you, and each of you, go back to the place from whence you came; and from thence be drawn on a Hurdle, to the place of Execution, where you ſhall be ſeverally Hang'd up by the Neck, and Cut down Alive; your Bodies ſhall be Ript open, your Privy Members Cut off, your Bowels taken out, and burnt before your Faces, your Heads ſhall be Severed from your Bodies, your Bodies reſpectively to be Divided into Four Quarters, and your Heads and Quarters are to be at the Diſpoſal of the King, and the Lord have Mercy upon your Souls.</q>
               <p>Then the Priſoners were carryed back to <hi>Newgate.</hi>

               <head>Sir <hi>JOHN FREIND</hi>'s Paper.</head>
               <p>KNowing that I muſt immediately give Account to God of all my Actions, and that I ought to be eſpecially careful of what I ſay in theſe Laſt Hours, I do ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly profeſs, That what I here deliver, is from my very Soul, with all the Heartineſs and Sincerity of a dying Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The Cauſe I am brought hither to ſuffer for, I do firmly believe to be the Cauſe of God and True Religion, and, to the beſt and utmoſt of my Knowledge and Information, agreeable to the Laws of the Land, which I have evermore heard to require a firm Duty and Allegiance to our Sovereign; and that as no Foreign, ſo neither any Domeſtick Power can alienate our Allegiance. For it is altogether new and unintelligible to me, That the King's Subjects can depoſe and dethrone him on any account, or conſtitute any that have not an immediate Right in his place. We ought, I think, not to do this; and ſurely when it is done, to aſſiſt him in the Recovery of his Right, is juſtifiable, and our Duty. And however things may ſeem at preſent, I do <hi>believe,</hi> I am ſure I heartily <hi>pray,</hi> That he ſhall be one day Reſtored to his Rightful Throne and Dominions.</p>
               <p>As for any ſudden Deſcent of His Majeſty upon theſe His Dominions, in order to the Recovery of them, I declare I had no certain Knowledge of it, nor can I tell what grounds there was to believe it, ſo little Reaſon had I to be in a preſent Preparation for it. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is not expected I ſhould here endeavour to clear my ſelf of the Aſſaſſination, which was not the thing alledg'd againſt me; however, it was mentioned, through what means I know not: As it was inſinuated to my Diſadvantage, I forgive ſuch as were therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental: And I do alſo from the very bottom of my Soul, freely forgive, and beg of God to do ſo too, ſuch as were any ways acceſſary towards the taking away my Life, which I really look upon to be their Misfortune more than mine.</p>
               <p>I profeſs my ſelf, and I thank God I am ſo, a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though, God knows, a moſt unworthy and unprofitable part of it; of that Church which ſuffers ſo much at preſent for a ſtrict Adherence to Loyalty, the Laws, and Chriſtian Principles.</p>
               <q>For this I Suffer, and for this I Dye.</q>
               <p>Though I have a perfect Charity for People of all Profeſſions, and do heartily wiſh well, and would endeavour ſo to do, to all my Fellow-Subjects, of what Perſuaſions ſoever. And indeed, I have met with a great deal of Uprightneſs and Sincerity among ſome People of very different Opinions in Religious Matters.</p>
               <p>And I hope and deſire it may not be taken as an uncharitable Cenſure, or undue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that I objected to the Legality of Popiſh Evidence, being adviſed ſo to do for my better Security, upon the Foundation of a Statute-Law.</p>
               <p>Having own'd my ſelf a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I muſt take this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and I do it for God's Glory, to apply my ſelf to you that are Royaliſts of that Church, and of the ſame Faith and Principles with my ſelf: And I beg of you for God's ſake, and the love of your Souls, to be very conſtant and ſerious in all Religious Offices, and holy Duties of Divine Worſhip and Service; which I have too much neglected, as I own, to my great Sorrow: Let no Excuſe, no Dangers, prevent or hinder you in theſe moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and ſerious Matters, and be, I beſeech you, very careful and circumſpect in all your Actions, Behaviour and Converſation, as I earneſtly exhorted all that came to me.</p>
               <p>I have, I thank God, a great deal of Satisfaction in my preſent Sufferings, and have found it ſo ever ſince I have been under them: And bleſſed be God it doth continually encreaſe upon me. And I do now lay down my Life with all Chearfulneſs and Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in ſure and certain Hope of a Reſurrection to Eternal Life, through our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, through whoſe Merits alone I hope for the Pardon of my Sins, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of my Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo, O Lord, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit, for thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I do heartily and humbly beſeech Thee, Almighty God, and my moſt Gracious Father, to forgive and bleſs this Sinful Nation, deliver it from the Guilt of Rebellion, Blood and Perjury,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106669:26"/> that is now on all ſides more than ever, and from all thoſe other heinous Sins which cry aloud Preſerve and bleſs this Church. Comfort our diſtreſſed King; Reſtore him to his Right, and his Miſled Subjects to their Allegiance: Bleſs alſo his Royal Conſort, our Gracious Queen</hi> Mary; <hi>his Royal Highneſs the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>that he may grow in Stature, and in Favour with God and Man; Support and ſtrengthen all thoſe that ſuffer in any kind for a good Cauſe; Give them Patience under all their Afflictions, and a happy Deliverance out of them</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forgive all mine Enemies. Pardon my former Neglect, and Remiſsneſs in Religious Worſhip, and Holy Duties, and all the Sins I have been Guilty of to this very Moment. Conſider my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Accept my Tears; and now Thou art pleaſed to take me hence, take me into thy Favour, and Grant that my Soul may be without Spot preſented unto Thee, through the Merits of thy moſt dearly beloved Son, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>

               <p>IT hath not been my cuſtom to uſe many Words, and I ſhall not be long upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, having Buſineſs of much greater Conſequence to employ my Thoughts upon. I thank God I am now in a full Diſpoſition to Charity, and therefore ſhall make no Complaints, either of the Hardſhips of my Trial, or any other Rigours put upon me. However, one Circumſtance I think my ſelf oblig'd to mention; it was ſworn againſt me by Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> That I had own'd to him, that I had Seen and Read a Commiſſion from the King, to Levy War upon the Perſon of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> Now I muſt declare, That the Tenour of the King's Commiſſion, which I ſaw, was general, and directed to all His Loving Subjects, to Raiſe and Levy War againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Adherents, and to Seize all Forts, Caſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which, I ſuppoſe, may be a cuſtomary Form of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Authority to make War; but I muſt confeſs, I am not much acquainted with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Nature: But as for any Commiſſion particularly levelled againſt the Perſon of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> I neither ſaw nor heard of any ſuch.</p>
               <p>It's true, I was privy to the Deſign upon the Prince, but was not to act in it, and am fully ſatisfied that very few, or none, knew of it, but thoſe who undertook to do it.</p>
               <p>I freely acknowledge, and think it for my Honour to ſay, That I was entirely in the Intereſt of the King, being always firmly perſuaded of the Juſtice of his Cauſe, and lookt upon it as my Duty, both as a Subject, and an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> to aſſiſt him in the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Throne, which I believed him to be deprived of, contrary to all Right and Juſtice; taking the Laws and Conſtitution of my Countrey for my Guide.</p>
               <p>As for my Religion, I dye in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in which I was Educated.</p>
               <p>And as I freely forgive all the World, ſo whoever I may any ways have injured, I heartily ask them Pardon.</p>
